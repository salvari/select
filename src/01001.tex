The simple resistor network shown here is known as a {\it passive averager}.  Describe what the word "passive" means in this context, and write an equation describing the output voltage ($V_d$) in terms of the input voltages ($V_a$, $V_b$, and $V_c$):

$$\epsfbox{01001x01.eps}$$

Hint: there is a network theorem that directly applies to this form of circuit, and it is known as {\it Millman's Theorem}.  Research this theorem and use it to generate your equation!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Passive" means that the circuit contains no amplifying components.

$$V_d = {{V_a + V_b + V_c} \over 3}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students need to realize that even passive circuits are able to model (some) mathematical functions!  Ask your students if they can think of any network analysis methods to easily calculate the output voltage ($V_d$) of this circuit, given the input voltages.  There is one theorem in particular that works very well for this particular circuit.
