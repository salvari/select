It is very important that the secondary winding of a {\it current transformer} (CT) never be open-circuited while in operation!  Explain why this is an important safety consideration.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

An open-circuited secondary winding on a current transformer is capable of generating {\it extremely} high voltages.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are a couple of different ways to explain {\it why} current transformers pose this safety hazard.  One could explain it in terms of the winding ratio, or perhaps in terms of its function as an AC "current source".  Do not be surprised if your students present multiple explanations for this behavior.
