Suppose an AC signal amplifier circuit has a voltage gain (ratio) of 5.  That is, $V_{out}$ is five times as large as $V_{in}$:

$$\epsfbox{00828x01.eps}$$

Translate this voltage gain ratio into a decibel figure.  Explain why the conversion from voltage gain ratio to decibels is not the same as conversion of a power gain ratio to decibels.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$A_V =$ 13.98 dB

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the nature of the "Bel" unit: it is fundamentally a unit of {\it power} gain, not voltage or current gain.  So, representing voltage or current gains in units of either Bels or decibels means representing those voltage or current gains {\it in terms of how much power gain they equate to}.

%INDEX% Gain, relationship of voltage gain to power gain (in units of decibels)
