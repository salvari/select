Calculate the operating frequency of the following oscillator circuit, if $C_1$ = 0.047 $\mu$F and $L_1$ = 150 mH:

$$\epsfbox{02614x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f$ = 1.896 kHz

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note to your students that the following formula (used to obtain the answer shown) is valid only if the tank circuit's $Q$ factor is high (at least 10 is the rule-of-thumb):

$$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}}$$
