Suppose an ammeter has a range of 0 to 1 milliamp, and an internal resistance of 1000 $\Omega$:

$$\epsfbox{00370x01.eps}$$

Show how a single resistor could be connected to this ammeter to extend its range to {\it 0 to 10} amps.  Calculate the resistance of this "range" resistor, as well as its necessary power dissipation rating.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{00370x02.eps}$$

A power dissipation rating of at least 10 watts is necessary for this application.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ammeter ranging is a very practical example of current divider circuitry.
