The 8-pin Dual-Inline-Package (DIP) is a common format in which single and dual operational amplifiers are housed.  Shown here are the case outlines for two 8-pin DIPs.  Draw the internal op-amp connections for a single op-amp unit, and for a dual op-amp unit:

You will need to research some op-amp datasheets to find this information.  Examples of single op-amp chips include the LM741, CA3130, and TL081.  Examples of dual op-amp chips include the LM1458 and TL082.
