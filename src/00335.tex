Suppose you needed a resistance equal to precisely 235 $\Omega$ for the construction of a precision electrical meter circuit.  The only resistors available to you are two 1 k$\Omega$ resistors, one 500 $\Omega$ resistor, and a rheostat variable between 600 and 1000 ohms.  Design a parallel resistor network using any combination of these components that will yield a total resistance of 235 $\Omega$.  If you use the rheostat in your design, specify its resistance setting.

This problem is an exercise in estimation, and algebraic equation manipulation.  Estimation will reveal which resistors should be combined together, and algebraic manipulation will give the exact values needed.
