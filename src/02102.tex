The {\it Pythagorean Theorem} is used to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides:

$$\epsfbox{02102x01.eps}$$

Write the standard form of the Pythagorean Theorem, and give an example of its use.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you research this one on your own!

Follow-up question: identify an application in AC circuit analysis where the Pythagorean Theorem would be useful for calculating a circuit quantity such as voltage or current.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The Pythagorean Theorem is easy enough for students to find on their own that you should not need to show them.  A memorable illustration of this theorem are the side lengths of a so-called {\it 3-4-5} triangle.  Don't be surprised if this is the example many students choose to give.
