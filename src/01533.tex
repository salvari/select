Explain how you plan to test for and eliminate (if necessary) any {\it crossover distortion} from your amplifier circuit.  Do you suspect crossover distortion will be more noticeable at low volume levels or high volume levels?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Crossover distortion is detected by using an oscilloscope to display the output waveform, and is eliminated through proper biasing of the push-pull transistor pair.  This type of distortion is generally more noticeable at low volume levels, but I'll let you explain exactly why!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Crossover distortion is the bane of Class B amplifier designs, and may be frustrating for the beginning electronics student to successfully eliminate without causing other problems (such as transistor overheating from excessive Class AB biasing).
