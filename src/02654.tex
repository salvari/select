Determine what will happen to the output voltage ($V_{out}$) and resistor $R_1$'s current ($I_{R_1}$) in this circuit as the resistance of $R_2$ is {\it increased}:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

As $R_2$ increases in resistance, $V_{out}$ increases and $I_{R_1}$ decreases.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing special here -- just a qualitative analysis of a very simple voltage divider circuit.
