$$\epsfbox{02759x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02759}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an {\bf OR} gate, so named because its output goes high if either input A is high {\it or} input B is high.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Your students should have no great difficulty identifying this particular logic gate if they have a good digital electronics reference book at their disposal.
