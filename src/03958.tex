Suppose that an operational amplifier has a gain-bandwidth product of 1.5 MHz.  How much gain could I obtain in a voltage amplifier circuit using this op-amp and still be able to amplify signals up to 100 kHz in frequency before it starts "cutting off" like a low-pass filter?  Is this gain a maximum or a minimum value to consider?

\vskip 10pt

$A_V = $ \hskip 150pt {\it Maximum} or {\it minimum}?
