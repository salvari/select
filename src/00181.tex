%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Voltage is measured in the unit of the {\it volt} (V).
\item{$\bullet$} Current is measured in the unit of the {\it ampere}, or {\it amp} (A).
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance is measured in the unit of the {\it ohm} ($\Omega$).
\medskip

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Like all other physical quantities, there are units of measurement appropriate for specifying electrical quantities.  In this sense, the "volt," "amp," or "ohm" are no different from "gram," "yard," or "bushel."

%INDEX% Volt, unit
%INDEX% Ampere, unit
%INDEX% Ohm, unit
