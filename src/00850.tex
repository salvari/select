Write an equation that solves for the impedance of this series circuit.  The equation need not solve for the phase angle between voltage and current, but merely provide a scalar figure for impedance (in ohms):

$$\epsfbox{00850x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Z_{total} = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate this equation to produce two more; one solving for $R$ and the other solving for $X$.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students if this equation looks similar to any other mathematical equations they've seen before.  If not, square both sides of the equation so it looks like $Z^2 = R^2 + X^2$ and ask them again.
