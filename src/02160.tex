The output voltage of an {\it inverting converter} circuit is a function of the input voltage and the duty cycle of the switching signal, represented by the variable $D$ (ranging in value from 0\% to 100\%), where $D = {{t_{on}} \over {t_{on} + t_{off}}}$:

Based on this mathematical relationship, calculate the output voltage of this converter circuit at these duty cycles, assuming an input voltage of 40 volts:

\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 25\% ; $V_{out}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 50\% ; $V_{out}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 75\% ; $V_{out}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 100\% ; $V_{out}$ =

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 0\% ; $V_{out}$ = 0 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 25\% ; $V_{out}$ = 13.3 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 50\% ; $V_{out}$ = 40 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 75\% ; $V_{out}$ = 120 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $D$ = 100\% ; $V_{out}$ = 0 volts
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The calculations for this circuit should be straightforward, except for the last calculation with a duty cycle of $D$ = 100\%.  Here, students must take a close look at the circuit and not just follow the formula blindly.  

Note that the switching element in the schematic diagram is shown in generic form.  It would never be a mechanical switch, but rather a transistor of some kind.
