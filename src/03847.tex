A {\it comparator} may be thought of as a one-bit analog-to-digital converter:

$$\epsfbox{03847x01.eps}$$

Explain why this description of a comparator is appropriate.  What exactly is meant by the term "analog-to-digital converter," or ADC?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

All ADCs input one or more analog signals and output a discrete signal.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This description of a comparator is not just theoretical.  In many practical ADC circuits, a comparator is actually used as the primary analog-to-digital conversion device.  This is particularly true for {\it oversampling} or {\it Sigma-Delta} converters, which may be built around a single (1-bit) comparator.
