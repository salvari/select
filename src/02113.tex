Explain how you could calculate the capacitance value of a capacitor (in units of Farads), by measuring AC voltage, AC current, and frequency in a circuit of this configuration:

$$\epsfbox{02113x01.eps}$$

Write a single formula solving for capacitance given these three values ($V$, $I$, and $f$).

\underbar{file 02113}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$C = {I \over {2 \pi f V}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to show how they arrived at the formula for calculating $C$.  The algebra is not difficult, but some substitution is required.
