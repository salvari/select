%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The oscilloscope needs to be set in the "X-Y" mode.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is important for students to realize that the oscilloscope will not produce the desired display if configured for the normal "time-domain" display.  For the circuit to be able to work, the curve tracer must provide the horizontal sweep, hence the dual inputs to the oscilloscope.
