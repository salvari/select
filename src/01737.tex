Calculate the total current output to the load resistor by this set of parallel-connected current sources:

$$\epsfbox{01737x01.eps}$$

Also, calculate the voltage dropped across $R_{load}$.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The total current in this circuit is 4 mA, and the load voltage is 18.8 volts.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: indicate the polarity of the voltage across the load resistor with "+" and "-" symbols.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students collectively agree on a procedure they may use to accurate discern series voltage sums and polarities.  Guide their discussion, helping them identify principles that are true and valid for all series circuits.
