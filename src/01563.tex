Does a series LC circuit "appear" capacitive or inductive (from the perspective of the AC source powering it) when the source frequency is greater than the circuit's resonant frequency?  What about a parallel resonant circuit?  In each case, explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A series LC circuit will appear {\it inductive} when the source frequency exceeds the resonant frequency.  A parallel LC circuit will appear {\it capacitive} in the same condition.
