Although most high-power AC loads are inductive in nature, some are capacitive.  Explain what you would have to do to correct for the {\it leading} power factor of a large capacitive load, provided the power factor were low enough to warrant the expense of equipment to correct it.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If inductive loads have their low power factors corrected by the addition of parallel capacitors, the solution to correcting low power factor for a capacitive load should be easy to identify.  I'll let you figure out the answer to this!

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: explain how you could exploit the inductive nature of electric motors and other more common load devices in correcting for an excessively low leading power factor.
