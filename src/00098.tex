What would happen if a multimeter were connected across the component labeled "C1" on this printed circuit board, as shown?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The meter would create a short-circuit with the battery.  Determine what damage this short-circuit might cause, to all components involved.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Even though it might not appear that the meter is "shorting" the battery in this example, it most certainly is.  In asking students to determine the resulting damage from such an action, it is important for them to trace the path of "fault current" through the circuit.  Those components within the path of fault current are in risk of damage, while those components not within the path of fault current are not at risk.
