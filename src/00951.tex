What diode performance parameter establishes the limit for maximum frequency of AC which it may rectify?  If you were to examine a diode datasheet, what parameter (or parameters) would be the most important in answering this question?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it Reverse Recovery Time} ($t_{rr}$) is a very important parameter limiting maximum rectification frequency.  {\it Junction capacitance} ($C_j$) is another.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to describe what the "ideal" $t_{rr}$ and $C_j$ values would be for a diode with unlimited rectification bandwidth.
