{\it Clamper} circuits are sometimes referred to as {\it DC restorer} circuits.  Explain why.

\vskip 10pt

Does a "clamper" circuit change the shape of a voltage waveform, like a "clipper" circuit does?  Explain why or why not.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Clamper" circuits provide just enough DC bias voltage to offset an AC signal so that almost its entire shape occurs either above or below ground potential.
