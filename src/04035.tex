A {\it series} is a very important concept in mathematics.  The common notation for a "series" looks something like this (a type of "geometric" series is shown here as an example):

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n$$

Explain what this notation means, and how we may approximate the value of a series for a finite value of $n$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "series" is comprised of a set of terms added together, each term related to the others by a common form, distinguished only by the incrementing or decrementing of a common variable.  To illustrate by example, here is an expansion of the geometric series shown in the question:

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = x^0 + x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + \cdots + x^{\infty}$$

Follow-up question: what do you think the value of this series would be if the value of $x$ was greater than (positive) 1?  What if $x = 0$?  What if $0 < x < 1$?

The purpose of this question is to familiarize students with the concept of a mathematical series, and the notation used to describe series.
