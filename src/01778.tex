Size the resistor in this voltage divider circuit to provide 3.2 volts to the load, assuming that the load will draw 10 mA of current at this voltage:

$$\epsfbox{01778x01.eps}$$

As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of both resistors.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

R = 1 k$\Omega$.  The 470 $\Omega$ resistor will fare well even with a (low) power dissipation rating of ${1 \over 8}$ watt, though the 1 k$\Omega$ resistor will need to be rated in excess of 1/4 watt.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what would change in this divider circuit if the load were to suddenly draw more, or less, current.
