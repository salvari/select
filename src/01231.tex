How is it possible to tell that {\it overflow} has occurred in the addition of binary numbers, without converting the binary sums to decimal form and having a human being verify the answers?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Check the sign bit of the answer, and compare it to the sign bits of the {\it addend} and {\it augend}.

Challenge question: under what condition(s) is overflow impossible?  When can we add two binary numbers together and know with certainty that the answer will be correct?

Later, this concept of overflow checking should be applied to a real circuit, with students designing logic gate arrays to detect the presence of overflow.  First, though, they must learn to recognize its presence analytically.
