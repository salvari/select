Suppose a very important piece of electronic equipment (nuclear reactor shutdown controls, for instance) needed to be supplied with {\it uninterruptible} DC power.  For reliability's sake, this circuit gets its power from three (redundant) DC voltage sources:

$$\epsfbox{00985x01.eps}$$

The only problem with this scenario is the possibility of one of these power sources internally short-circuiting.  Describe what would happen if one of the three DC power sources developed an internal short-circuit, and explain how this problem could be avoided by placing diodes in the circuit.

Challenge question: it would be nice if there were indicator lamps in the system to warn maintenance personnel of a shorted power supply.  Is there any way you can think of to place light bulbs in this system somewhere, so that one will light up in the event of a power supply failure?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss both the nature of the problem, and of the solution, with your students.  Why does the proposed solution work to eliminate power failure in the event of a short-circuit internal to one of the power sources?
