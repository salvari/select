Calculate all listed values for this transformer circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01879x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{primary} = $
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{secondary} = $
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{primary} = $
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{secondary} = $
\medskip

Explain whether this is a {\it step-up}, {\it step-down}, or {\it isolation} transformer, and also explain what distinguishes the "primary" winding from the "secondary" winding in any transformer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{primary} = 3.7 \hbox{ volts}$
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{secondary} = 12.0 \hbox{ volts}$
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{primary} = 26.1 \hbox{ mA}$
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{secondary} = 8.02 \hbox{ mA}$
\medskip

This is a {\it step-up} transformer.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Most transformer problems are nothing more than ratios, but some students find ratios difficult to handle.  Questions such as this are great for having students come up to the board in the front of the classroom and demonstrating how they obtained the results.

Note to your students how the distinction between a step-up and a step-down transformer is simply a matter of usage.  It is possible to use a transformer either way!
