%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{AB} =$ 397 VAC

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In reality, this is nothing more than an exercise in Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL): determining the voltage between two points in a loop, knowing the voltages between other points in that same loop.  Two principal challenges present themselves in this exercise: identifying the loop, and relating the dot convention to polarity markings.  Different students will likely have different approaches to this problem, so it should make for an interesting discussion!
