Synchronous AC motors operate with zero {\it slip}, which is what primarily distinguishes them from induction motors.  Explain what "slip" means for an induction motor, and why synchronous motors do not have it.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Synchronous motors do not slip because their rotors are magnetized so as to always follow the rotating magnetic field precisely.  Induction motor rotors are become magnetized by induction, necessitating a difference in speed ("slip") between the rotating magnetic field and the rotor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The concept of "slip" is confusing to many students, so be prepared to help them understand by way of multiple explanations, Socratic questioning, and perhaps live demonstrations.
