A trend in CMOS logic gate development is toward lower and lower operating voltages.  The "AUC" family of CMOS logic, for example, is able to operate at less than 2 volts $V_{DD}$!

Explain why this is a trend in modern logic circuit design.  What benefits result from lower operating voltages?  What possible disadvantages also result?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Lower operating voltages result in less power dissipation.  However, noise margins become "tighter" under the same conditions, which is a disadvantage.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss this trend with your students, citing examples from industry literature if possible.  Be sure to ask your students {\it why} lower operating voltages reduces power dissipation (with reference to Joule's Law, please!), and also why this reduces noise margins.
