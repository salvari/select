Suppose you needed to build a circuit that pulsed a lamp on and off (once) when a pushbutton is pressed and held.  In other words, you wanted the lamp to do this:

$$\epsfbox{03136x01.eps}$$

Draw a ladder logic diagram for a circuit that would fulfill this function, using at least one time-delay relay.

$$\epsfbox{03136x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a good problem-solving exercise, figuring out how to creatively combine time-delay relays to perform a specific function.
