Suppose a technician attempted to measure the resistance of resistor R5 on this printed circuit board:

$$\epsfbox{00362x01.eps}$$

What is wrong with doing this?

\underbar{file 00362}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

R5 is not the only component whose resistance is being measured!

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what components on this printed circuit board {\it may} be measured with the ohmmeter without error?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is very important for students to understand: the fact that the resistance of an individual component cannot be measured in a circuit, unless it is guaranteed that the ohmmeter's measuring current passes through that component only.
