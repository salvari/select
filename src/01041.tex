If we wish to solve for the value of three inter-related variables (i.e. $x + y + z = 0$), how many equations do we need in our "system" of simultaneous equations, total?

Graphically, what does the solution set ($x$,$y$,$z$) represent for a system of equations with three variables?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Three variables require three equations for solution.  Graphically, the solution set represents the point at which three planes of infinite area intersect.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to graphically contrast the scenario of three variables and three equations against two variables and two equations.  Where is the solution set represented in a two-variable, two-equation system?  How many we extrapolate from this situation to one where three variables and three equations are involved?
