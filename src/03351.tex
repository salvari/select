Resistors are often used to drop excessive voltage so that low-voltage devices may successfully operate from the power provided by high(er)-voltage sources.  For example, this 1.7 volt light-emitting diode (LED) uses a resistor connected in series to be able to operate from the output of the 22 volt generator:

$$\epsfbox{03351x01.eps}$$

Calculate the necessary resistance of this resistor, as well as its minimum power rating (choose from 1/8 watt, 1/4 watt, 1/2 watt, 1 watt, or 2 watt).

\vskip 10pt

$R$ = \hskip 140pt $P$ (rating) =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R$ = 1.1278 k$\Omega$ \hskip 100pt $P$ (rating) = 1/2 watt minimum
