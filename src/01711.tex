The difference between these figures is {\it precision}: the degree of uncertainty in the value expressed.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is important for students to understand that although a computer may see these three quantities as precisely equivalent, they are actually not.  Human beings do not write extra zeros if they do not have to, and so these zeros serve to indicate extra certainty in the figure.
