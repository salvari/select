This current divider circuit has a problem.  The voltage between test points TP2 and TP1 varies with the potentiometer position, but the voltage between test points TP3 and TP1 remains at 0 volts no matter where the potentiometer is set:

$$\epsfbox{03943x01.eps}$$

Identify the most likely fault which would account for these measurements.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There is an "open" fault in resistor $R_2$, or somewhere in series with $R_2$ (bad solder connection, open trace, etc.).

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: identify which direction of potentiometer shaft motion (clockwise or counter-clockwise) should increase the voltage between test points TP2 and TP1.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students how they determined the identity of the fault.  Also, be sure to discuss the follow-up question with them: how to determine the proper direction to turn the potentiometer shaft in order to increase $V_{TP2-TP1}$.  It is important that your students realize how a 3/4 turn potentiometer works, and what to expect when the shaft is turned.
