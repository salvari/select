When you look at the schematic diagram for a passive integrator circuit, it ought to remind you of another type of circuit you've seen before: a {\it passive filter} circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01898x01.eps}$$

What specific type of passive filter does a passive integrator circuit resemble?  Is the resemblance the same for LR integrators as well, or just RC integrators?  What does this resemblance tell you about the frequency response of a passive integrator circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The answer to this question is so easy for you to research, it would be an insult to print it here!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is fairly easy, and provides a logical step to prepare students for frequency-domain analysis of passive integrator circuits.
