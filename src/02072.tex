Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are considered "normally-off" devices, because their natural state with no signal applied to the base is no conduction between emitter and collector, like an open switch.  Are insulate-gate field-effect transistors (IGFETs) considered the same?  Why or why not?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

IGFETs may be manufactured {\it either} as "normally-on" or "normally-off" devices.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to elaborate on the answer given.  Do not accept a mindless recitation of the answer, that "it depends on how they're manufactured," but rather demand that some sort of explanation be given as to {\it why} an IGFET would be normally-on versus normally-off.
