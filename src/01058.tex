This Delta-connected three-phase power source provides three different voltage levels: 120 V, 208 V, and 240 V.  Determine which points of connection provide these voltages:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{AB} = V_{BC} = V_{AC} =$ 240 volts

\vskip 10pt

$V_{AG} = V_{CG} =$ 120 volts

\vskip 10pt

$V_{BG} =$ 208 volts

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Despite the fact that this connection scheme is quite common in industry, I have found little reference to it in textbooks.  The equilateral layout of the windings in this diagram facilitates graphical (phasor) analysis of the voltages, providing students with the opportunity to exercise their knowledge of trigonometry.
