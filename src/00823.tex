%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This circuit was purposely drawn in a convoluted fashion to force students to identify its configuration apart from the standard layout.  Many people lack the spatial reasoning skills to do this easily, and require a lot of practice before they become proficient.  Ask your more proficient students if they have any "tips" for helping those who struggle with problems like these.  Are there any simple methods which we may use to re-draw this circuit in an easier-to-understand form?
