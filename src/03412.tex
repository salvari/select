Calculate the value of $R_1$ necessary to create a total resistance of 855 $\Omega$:

\vskip 10pt

$R_1$ = 

$$\epsfbox{03412x01.eps}$$

Also, write an equation solving for the value of $R_1$ in terms of $R_T$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1$ = 2.728 k$\Omega$

$$R_1 = {1 \over { {1 \over R_T} - \left( {1 \over R_2} + {1 \over R_3} \right)}}$$
