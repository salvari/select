Calculate the voltage gain of this opamp circuit (as a ratio, not decibels):

$$\epsfbox{02715x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02715}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$A_V$ = 2.75

\vskip 10pt

It is okay if students express this answer as a negative quantity, since some texts teach the gain formula $A_V = -{R_f \over R_i}$.
