%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It needs to be understood that this is an AND gate only if you consider the "0" and "1" states as defined by voltage levels with respect to ground, and not by switch actuation.  Many students assume an actuated (pushed) switch is a "1" input and a de-actuated (unpushed) switch is a "0" input.  Not necessarily so!  In this circuit, the switches are connecting inputs to {\it ground}.  This means a closed (actuated) switch provides a low (0) input state, while an open (unactuated) switch provides a high (1) input state.
