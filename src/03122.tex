%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Both a "thou" and a "mil" refer to {\it one-thousandth of an inch}.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to remind your students that the "mil" (which is one "milli-inch") is {\it not} to be confused with a millimeter, which is of course a metric dimension rather than an Imperial dimension.

%INDEX% Mil, defined for PCB dimensions
%INDEX% Thou, defined for PCB dimensions
