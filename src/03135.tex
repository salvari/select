Suppose you needed to build a circuit that delayed the energization of a lamp when the button was pushed, and also delayed its turning off when the button was released.  In other words, you wanted the lamp to do this:

$$\epsfbox{03135x01.eps}$$

Draw a ladder logic diagram for a circuit that would fulfill this function, using at least one time-delay relay.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{03135x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: which relay controls the on-delay time, and which relay controls the off-delay time?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a good problem-solving exercise, figuring out how to creatively combine time-delay relays to perform a specific function.
