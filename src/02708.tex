The equation for voltage gain ($A_V$) in a typical inverting, single-ended opamp circuit is as follows:

$$A_V = {R_{1} \over R_{2}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$R_1$ is the feedback resistor (connecting the output to the inverting input)

$R_2$ is the other resistor (connecting the inverting input to voltage signal input terminal)

Suppose we wished to change the voltage gain in the following circuit from 3.5 to 4.9, but only had the freedom to alter the resistance of $R_{2}$:

$$\epsfbox{02708x01.eps}$$

Algebraically manipulate the gain equation to solve for $R_2$, then determine the necessary value of $R_2$ in this circuit to give it a voltage gain of 4.9.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$R_2 = {R_1 \over A_V}$$

\vskip 10pt

For the circuit shown, $R_2$ would have to be set equal to 1.571 k$\Omega$.
