The purpose of this circuit is to provide indication of when the rotary encoder shaft is in a particular position (matching the setting of the 8-position switch array):

$$\epsfbox{03845x01.eps}$$

Trace the directions of all currents in this circuit, {\it using electron flow notation}, when the encoder position matches the pre-set code entered at the switches.  Then, identify specific component failures that could result in the solenoid coil not energizing in this condition.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{03845x02.eps}$$

Potential component faults resulting in non-energization of solenoid:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} MOSFET failed open (drain-to-source)
\item{$\bullet$} Broken wire between MOSFET drain and solenoid coil
\item{$\bullet$} Loss of power ($V_{CC}$) to comparator circuit
\item{$\bullet$} Loss of power to encoder (only if switch code is {\it not} 0000 0000)
\medskip

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss fault options with your students, asking them to explain {\it why} each proposed fault would result in the solenoid not energizing.
