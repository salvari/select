Design a passive circuit that will create a "split" (+V/-V) power supply from a single voltage source:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

For low-current applications, the following resistor/capacitor network works remarkably well:

$$\epsfbox{02748x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what design constraints will dictate the sizes of the resistors and capacitors?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This simple filtered voltage divider circuit works well when the current draws are low, or at least very close to being equal, on the +V and -V load rails.  It does not work so well for highly asymmetrical loads, or where low quiescent current draw is important (low-power battery circuits, for example).  In applications requiring better +V/-V voltage stability, an opamp "follower" circuit is recommended after the voltage divider.
