Predict how the output frequency of this voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03758x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Inductor $L_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Inductor $L_2$ fails partially shorted:
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.  Note: the voltage-dependent capacitance of a {\it varactor} diode is given by the following equation:

$$C_j = {C_o \over {\sqrt{2V + 1}}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$C_J =$ Junction capacitance

$C_o =$ Junction capacitance with no applied voltage

$V = $ Applied reverse junction voltage

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
