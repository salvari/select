A simple time-delay relay may be constructed by connecting a large capacitor in parallel with the relay coil, like this:

$$\epsfbox{03139x01.eps}$$

Explain how this circuit works, and also determine what type of time-delay relay function is provided by it (NOTO, NOTC, NCTO, or NCTC).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Normally-open, timed-open (NOTO).

Follow-up question: what purpose does the diode serve in this circuit?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

For substantial time delays (many seconds) on large relays (high-current coils), the capacitor must be {\it huge}, making this a somewhat impractical circuit for all but miniature relays.
