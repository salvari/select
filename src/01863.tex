Calculate the impedance value necessary to balance this AC bridge, expressing your answer in both polar and rectangular forms:

$$\epsfbox{01863x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01863}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

${\bf Z} =$ 1.975 k$\Omega$ $\angle$ 90$^{o}$ (polar form)

${\bf Z} =$ 0 + j1.975 k$\Omega$ (rectangular form)

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what type and size of component will provide this exact amount of impedance at 400 Hz?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

So long as complex quantities are used, AC bridge circuits "balance" just the same way that DC bridge circuits balance.  Consequently, this is really nothing new for your students if they've already studied DC Wheatstone bridge circuits.
