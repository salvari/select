How many poles does an alternator have if it generates 400 Hz power at a shaft speed of 6000 RPM?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

8 poles, which is the same as 4 pole {\it pairs}.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate the speed/poles/frequency equation to solve for the frequency generated ($f$) given the number of poles ($N$) and the generator speed ($S$).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some references provide equations in terms of {\it pole pairs} instead of individual alternator poles.
