There is something wrong in this motor control circuit.  When the start button is pressed, the contactor energizes but the motor itself does not run:

Identify a good place to check with your multimeter to diagnose the nature of the fault, and explain your reasoning.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Try checking for line voltages at the "line" (source) side of the contactor, between terminals 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 1 and 3, with the contactor energized (motor is supposed to be running).  I'll leave it to you to explain why this is a good place to check first.

Discuss with your students the various options they have in diagnostic steps, and what they think of the step proposed in the answer.  Troubleshooting scenarios such as this as excellent for stimulating active class discussions, so take advantage of it!
