The voltage-dependent capacitance of a {\it varactor diode} is given by the following equation:

$$C_j = {C_o \over {\sqrt{2V + 1}}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$C_J =$ Junction capacitance

$C_o =$ Junction capacitance with no applied voltage

$V = $ Applied reverse junction voltage 

\vskip 10pt

Combine this equation with the standard equation for frequency in a resonant LC circuit to arrive at a new equation giving resonant frequency in terms of $C_o$, $V$, and $L$.
