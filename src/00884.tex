Would you characterize this transistor amplifier as being {\it inverting} or {\it noninverting}, with the base terminal of transistor Q2 being considered the input?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an {\it inverting} amplifier.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to remove transistor Q1 (and its collector resistor) from the circuit and try answering the question then.  It should be easy to determine whether the circuit is inverting or noninverting in that configuration.  Then, have your students "insert" Q1 and its collector resistor back into the circuit and re-analyze.  Does the presence of Q1 change anything?  Why or why not?
