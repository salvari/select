An AC electric motor operating under loaded conditions draws a current of 11 amps (RMS) from the 120 volt (RMS) 60 Hz power lines.  The measured phase shift between voltage and current for this motor is 34$^{o}$, with voltage leading current.

Determine the equivalent parallel combination of resistance ($R$) and inductance ($L$) that is electrically equivalent to this operating motor.

$L_{parallel} =$ 51.75 mH

Challenge question: in the parallel LR circuit, the resistor will dissipate a lot of energy in the form of heat.  Does this mean that the electric motor, which is electrically equivalent to the LR network, will dissipate the same amount of heat?  Explain why or why not.

If students get stuck on the challenge question, remind them that an electric motor does mechanical {\it work}, which requires energy.
