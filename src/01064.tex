Prior to the advent of zener diodes, {\it gas-discharge} tubes and bulbs were commonly used as voltage regulating devices.

Explain how such a device regulates voltage, and comment on whether or not this type of device is still practical in modern circuit design.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Gas discharge devices, like zener diodes, exploit the sharply vertical portions of their current/voltage transfer functions to regulate voltage over a wide range of current:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The gas discharge lamp's transfer function may be confusing to analyze at first, but it makes sense once students recall the principle of gas ionization with increasing voltage.  Ask them to explain what the significance of each graph's vertical portions is, in the context of voltage regulation.
