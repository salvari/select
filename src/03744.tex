Sometimes a {\it feedback network} is purposely placed in an amplifier circuit, like the $R_f$-$C_f$ combination shown in the following schematic:

$$\epsfbox{03744x01.eps}$$

Explain what will happen to the amplifier circuit's performance if either one of the components in this feedback network fails open.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The amplifier's gain will increase, possibly to the point of distorting the signal.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
