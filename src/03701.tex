Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03701x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open: {\it No current in circuit, no voltage across $R_1$, no voltage across $R_2$, full source voltage across $D_1$}.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails shorted: {\it Increased current in circuit, increased voltage across $R_1$, increased voltage across $R_2$, little voltage across $D_1$}.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it No current in circuit, no voltage across $D_1$, full source voltage across $R_1$, no voltage across $R_2$}.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it No current in circuit, no voltage across $D_1$, no voltage across $R_1$, full source voltage across $R_2$}.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
