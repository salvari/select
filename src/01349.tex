The circuit shown here is called an {\it S-R latch}:

$$\epsfbox{01349x01.eps}$$

Complete the truth table for this latch circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01349x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01349}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01349x03.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: The final state of this truth table (where the "Set" and "Reset" inputs are both high) is usually referred to as {\it invalid}.  Explain why.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The "latch" state is the most interesting in this circuit.  Discuss what this means with your students, especially since it is impossible to describe the "latch" state in terms of fixed 1's and 0's.
