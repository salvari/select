%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The ohmmeter's indication is the "final word" on resistance.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts.  Use precision resistors for $R_1$ and $R_2$, and use any standard resistor value for $R_x$ between 1 k$\Omega$ and 100 k$\Omega$.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
