{\it Capacitance} is a very important property in many types of electric circuits.  Define what "capacitance" is, and what causes it.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Capacitance" is the capacity of two separated conductors to store energy in the form of an electric field, resulting from an applied voltage.  You may also find a definition of "capacitance" stated in terms of opposition to change in applied voltage over time.

\vskip 10pt

Capacitance is caused by the establishment of an electric field between two conductors.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask students what unit of measurement capacitance is expressed in.  Also, ask them if they think the capacitance of any given conductor pair changes with the applied voltage or stored energy, or if capacitance is a quantity independent of particular electrical conditions.
