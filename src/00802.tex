Ideally, what should the output voltage of an op-amp do if the noninverting voltage is greater (more positive) than the inverting voltage?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In this condition, the output of the op-amp should saturate positive (+V), as if a direct connection were made inside the op-amp between the output terminal and the +V power supply terminal:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Determining which "way" the output of an op-amp drives under different input voltage conditions is confusing to many students.  Discuss this with them, and ask them to present any principles or analogies they use to remember "which way is which."
