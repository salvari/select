Suppose a voltmeter has a range of 0 to 10 volts, and an internal resistance of 100 k$\Omega$:

$$\epsfbox{00369x01.eps}$$

Show how a single resistor could be connected to this voltmeter to extend its range to {\it 0 to 50} volts.  Calculate the resistance of this "range" resistor, as well as its necessary power dissipation rating.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{00369x02.eps}$$

A power dissipation rating of ${1 \over 8}$ watt would be more than sufficient for this application.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Voltmeter ranging is a very practical example of voltage divider circuitry.
