Plot the magnetic flux ($\Phi$) over time in the core of an ideal transformer, given a square-wave voltage applied to the primary winding:

$$\epsfbox{01671x01.eps}$$

Hint: The output voltage (measured at the secondary winding) will also be a square wave, perfectly in-phase with the source (primary) voltage.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have students relate the equation $E_{L} = N {d \phi \over dt}$ to this problem, discussing the flux wave-shape in terms of rate-of-change over time.
