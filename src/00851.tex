Capacitors and inductors are complementary components -- both conceptually and mathematically, they seem to be almost exact opposites of each other.  Calculate the total impedance of this series-connected inductor and capacitor network:

$$\epsfbox{00851x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

${\bf Z_{total}} =$ 13 $\Omega$ $\angle$ -90$^{o}$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: does this circuit "appear" to be inductive or capacitive from the source's point of view?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, the complementary nature of inductive and capacitive reactances is plain to see: they subtract in series.  Challenge your students by asking them what the total impedance of this circuit would be if the two reactances were equal.
