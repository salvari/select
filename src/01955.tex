Small electrical wires are almost always sized by {\it gauge} rather than by {\it circular mils} (cmils).  So, if you had to calculate the resistance of a length of 22-gauge copper wire and did not have the proper tools to measure the wire's diameter, how could you find the equivalent cross-sectional area in circular mils so as to use the equation $R = {\rho l \over A}$?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This information may be found in a {\it wire gauge table}, where gauge numbers and circular mil values are cross-referenced.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Show your students a wire gauge table, if their textbooks do not already contain one.
