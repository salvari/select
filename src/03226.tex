Ideal {\it voltage sources} and ideal {\it current sources}, while both being sources of electrical power, behave very differently from one another:

$$\epsfbox{03226x01.eps}$$

Explain how each type of electrical source would behave if connected to a variable-resistance load.  As this variable resistance were increased and decreased, how would each type of source respond?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

An ideal voltage source will output as much or as little current as necessary to maintain a constant voltage across its output terminals, for any given load resistance.  An ideal current source will output as much or as little voltage as necessary to maintain a constant current through it, for any given load resistance.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to think of a few "thought experiment" scenarios where voltage and current sources could be put to test.  Have them invent voltage and current values for these voltage and current sources, respectively, then calculate all other circuit parameters given several different values of load resistance.
