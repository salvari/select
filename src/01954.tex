The cross-sectional area of wires is often measured in units of {\it circular mils} rather than square inches or other common area units.  Explain how the "circular mil" is defined, and how it is calculated for round wires.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The "circular mil" is defined as the area of a circle with a diameter of ${1 \over 1000}$ inch (a diameter of one {\it mil}).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Explain how this is analogous to the "square inch" being defined as the area of a square measuring one inch on a side.  If you need to approach the definition in smaller conceptual steps, you might want to first define what a "circular inch" is before you define what a "circular mil" is.
