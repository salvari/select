Identify some realistic component failures that would definitely prevent this oscillator circuit from oscillating:

$$\epsfbox{03755x01.eps}$$

For each of the faults you propose, explain {\it why} the oscillations will cease.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note: The fault list shown here is not comprehensive.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge shorting across any of the phase-shift resistors ($R_1$ through $R_3$).
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_4$ failing open.
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ failing in any mode.
\medskip

Follow-up question: how would you rank the listed faults in order of probability?  In other words, which of these faults do you suppose would be more likely than the others, least likely than the others, etc.?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of assessing probable faults given very limited information about the circuit's behavior.  An important part of troubleshooting is being able to decide what faults are more likely than others, and questions such as this help develop that skill.
