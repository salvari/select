%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The IGBT is a hybrid device, combining the best attributes of MOSFET and BJT in a single component.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: describe some typical applications for the IGBT which make use of these advantages.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The given answer is accurate, yet not very specific.  Ask your students to explain exactly what attributes of MOSFET and BJT are exhibited by the IGBT, and why.
