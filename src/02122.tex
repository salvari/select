%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use an audio frequency impedance matching (1000:8 ohms) transformer for this exercise, using a load resistance great enough not to overload the signal generator powering it.  I recommend using a 100 k$\Omega$ resistor for the load.  With the audio transformer's impedance ratio, this should appear as an 800 $\Omega$ load to the signal generator.  Avoid frequencies below 1 kHz -- power line frequency is much too low for this type of transformer.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
