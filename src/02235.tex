A student builds this common-emitter amplifier so they he may amplify the audio signals from a microphone to power a speaker:

$$\epsfbox{02235x01.eps}$$

Unfortunately, the results are considerably less than expected: although some sound does come out of the speaker, it is not enough to be considered a success.  Another student inspects the design and cryptically mumbles something about "poor impedance matching," leaving the first student somewhat confused.

Explain what {\it impedance matching} means in this context, where the mis-match might be in this circuit, and what might be done to correct it.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I won't reveal all the answers here, but I will provide a visual hint:

$$\epsfbox{02235x02.eps}$$

Ideally, the impedance-matching transformer will have a turns ratio of approximately 30:1 to match the output impedance of the amplifier circuit with the impedance of the speaker.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note to your students that the addition of a transformer is not the only viable option for solving this impedance mis-match problem.  One could add another stage of transistor amplification (of the right type, of course).

One point not touched upon in the answer is a possible mis-match of impedances between the microphone and the amplifier {\it input}.  Since the microphone impedance was not specified, one cannot tell whether there is an impedance mis-match or not.
