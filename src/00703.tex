In this filter circuit, how will the filter's cutoff frequency be affected by changes in the potentiometer position?  Be as specific as you can in your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a "trick" question: $f_{cutoff}$ is unaffected by changes in the potentiometer's position.

Follow-up question: what {\it does} change as the potentiometer wiper is moved back and forth along its adjustment range?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what the function of the op-amp is (with potentiometer feedback), taken by itself.  If there were no filter circuit in place at all, but $V_{in}$ connected straight to the op-amp's noninverting input, what function would the potentiometer adjustment serve?
