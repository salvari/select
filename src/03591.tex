A very large 3-phase alternator at a hydroelectric dam has the following continuous full-power ratings:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} 600 MW power output
\item{$\bullet$} 15 kV line voltage
\item{$\bullet$} 23.686 kA line current
\medskip

Calculate the continuous full-load apparent power for this alternator (in MVA), its continuous full-load reactive power (in MVAR), and its power factor (in percent).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$S$ = 615.38 MVA \hskip 30pt $Q$ = 136.72 MVAR \hskip 30pt P.F. = 97.5\%

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

These figures came from a real hydroelectric generator that I saw once on a tour.  Needless to say, this alternator was {\it very} large!
