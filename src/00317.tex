The presence of a "ground" wire increases the degree of electrical safety for anyone using an electrical appliance.  It entails having a third "prong" on the power plug, connecting with a third hole on the power receptacle, which connects to a separate wire running all the way back to the power system's grounding point:

But why not eliminate all that extra wiring, and simply connect the third hole on the power receptacle to the "neutral" wire?  

$$\epsfbox{00317x02.eps}$$

Why would this idea be unwise?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Using the neutral conductor as a safety ground is a bad idea, in the event the neutral wire were to ever fail "open" between the receptacle and the system ground point.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss this particular failure scenario with your students, drawing a schematic diagram if necessary.  Not only does this illustrate the importance of having a separate ground conductor, but it also shows how the neutral wire can potentially be unsafe to touch!
