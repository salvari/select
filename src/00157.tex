Given two lengths of metal wire, which one will have the least electrical resistance: one that is short, or one that is long?  Assume all other factors are equal (same metal type, same wire diameter, etc.).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The short wire will have less electrical resistance than the long wire.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Many analogies exist to express this concept: water through a pipe, compressed air through a hose, etc.  Which pipe or hose is less restrictive: the short one or the long one?

%INDEX% Resistance, relation to conductor length
