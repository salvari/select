At your desk, choose a resistor from your parts kit with the following resistance value:

\vskip 10pt

$R = $ \underbar{\hskip 100pt}

\vskip 10pt

Calculate how much current will go through this resistor when connected to a voltage source with the following value:

\vskip 10pt

$V = $ \underbar{\hskip 100pt} \hskip 100pt $I$ (predicted) = \underbar{\hskip 100pt}

\vskip 10pt

Moving from your desk to the test bench, adjust the power supply to the specified voltage value (using your multimeter to verify the output voltage), connect the resistor to this power supply, and use your multimeter to measure the actual resistor current:

\vskip 10pt

\hskip 225pt $I$ (measured) = \underbar{\hskip 100pt}

\underbar{file 03334}
