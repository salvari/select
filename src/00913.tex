If a semiconductor PN junction is reverse-biased, ideally no continuous current will go through it.  However, in real life there will be a small amount of reverse-bias current that goes through the junction.  How is this possible?  What allows this reverse current to flow?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Minority carriers allow reverse current through a PN junction.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Review with your students what "minority carriers" are, and apply this concept to the PN junction.  Trace the motions of these minority carriers, and compare them with the motions of majority carriers in a forward-biased PN junction.
