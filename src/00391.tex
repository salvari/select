Plot the power dissipation of the load resistance, for several values between 1 k$\Omega$ and 20 k$\Omega$:

$$\epsfbox{00391x01.eps}$$

At what load resistance value is the load's power dissipation maximized?

\underbar{file 00391}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

What practical application can you think of for this principle of power maximization?  In what applications might we be interested in delivering the maximum amount of power possible to a load?

%INDEX% Maximum power transfer theorem
