%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I've used 47 $\mu$F electrolytic capacitors and 1N4001 diodes with good success on a 10 volt AC (RMS) power supply.  I recommend that students measure their own diodes to determine typical forward voltage ($V_F$).

Don't forget to mention the polarity sensitivity of these capacitors!  Electrolytic capacitors can explode violently if reverse-connected!
