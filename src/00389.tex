Calculate the voltage dropped across the load resistor, and the current through the load resistor, for the following load resistance values in this circuit:

Do the "boxed" components in this circuit behave more like a constant voltage source, or a constant current source?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you do the calculations on your own!  Hint: there is a way to figure out the answer without having to calculate all five load resistance scenarios.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: would you say that voltage sources are typically characterized as having high internal resistances or low internal resistances?  What about current sources?  Explain your answers.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to make a general prediction about the internal resistance of voltage sources.  Based on our calculations in this circuit, would you expect voltage sources to have high internal resistance or low internal resistance?  Also ask what constitutes a "high" or a "low" internal resistance for a power source.  Is this a relative determination, or an absolute determination?
