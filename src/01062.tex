Precision voltage reference regulators are often constructed of two zener diodes connected in series like this:

$$\epsfbox{01062x01.eps}$$

Explain why {\it two} zener diodes provide greater stability than a single zener diode would, and also draw a circuit showing a voltage source, so this component functions as a complete voltage reference.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Two zener diodes provide better stability than a single zener diode because the thermal coefficients of the diodes in their respective modes are complementary.  This assumes, of course, that the reverse-biased diode uses the {\it avalanche effect} to regulate voltage.

A functioning voltage regulator circuit might look like this:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may become confused by the word "complementary" as it is used in the answer.  Ask all your students to explain what this word means, in the context of two temperature coefficients and increased stability.
