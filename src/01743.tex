What does the {\it amp-hour} capacity of a chemical battery represent?  What does it mean if a battery is rated at, say, 150 amp-hours?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The amp-hour rating of a battery is an approximate indication of it's useful lifespan per charge.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: why not just rate batteries in terms of hours, instead of amp-hours?  Since time is the value we are most likely interested in, why bother to refer to current (amps) at all?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although the basic concept of an amp-hour battery rating is simple, it is important to realize that real battery discharge characteristics are very nonlinear, and therefore the simple "amps times hours" approach may yield grossly inaccurate predictions regarding battery life.
