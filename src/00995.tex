What does the term {\it transconductance} mean, with reference to a field-effect transistor?  Is the transconductance function for an FET a linear or a nonlinear relationship?  Explain why, making reference to an equation if at all possible to explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Transconductance" refers to the amount of change in drain current for a given amount of change in gate voltage (${\Delta I_D \over \Delta V_G}$).  The transconductance function for an FET is definitely nonlinear.

Challenge question: what unit of measurement would be appropriate for expressing transconductance in?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Transconductance is not just a parameter for JFETs, but also MOSFETs (IGFETs) and vacuum tubes.  Any voltage-controlled current-regulating device has a transconductance value (though it may change over the operating range of the device, just as $\beta$ changes over the operating range of a BJT).
