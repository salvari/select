Design an experimental circuit for determining the {\it pull-in} and {\it drop-out} current values for an electromagnetic relay coil.  Why would these statistics matter to us, when working with relay circuits?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The circuit for measuring these values is quite simple.  I leave the task of designing it in your capable hands!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The real challenge of this question, of course, is for the students to determine what in the world "pull-in" and "drop-out" current values are.  Once these definitions have been found, it is a very simple matter to experimentally determine them for any given relay.
