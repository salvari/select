Suppose this battery and light bulb circuit failed to work: 

$$\epsfbox{00121x01.eps}$$

Using nothing but a voltmeter, a technician measures voltage between the following sets of points:

\vskip 10pt

\item {$\bullet$} Between A and C: 0 volts
\item {$\bullet$} Between D and G: 12 volts
\item {$\bullet$} Between E and J: 0 volts
\item {$\bullet$} Between B and E: 12 volts

\vskip 10pt

From these voltage measurements, what can you tell about the condition of the battery, wiring, and light bulb?  Be as specific as you can.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: identify which of the four measurement are unnecessary in determining the precise location of the fault in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Based on these measurements, we are able to determine that the battery's voltage is 12 volts, that the light bulb has good continuity, and that there is a single break in the circuit between points D and E.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge answer: the two "0 volt" measurements are unnecessary in determining the location of the fault in this circuit.

Scenarios such as this are excellent for group discussion, encouraging students to think critically about the data and to apply their practical knowledge of electricity to a realistic problem.
