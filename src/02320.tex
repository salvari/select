Write the mathematical formula defining $\beta$ for a bipolar junction transistor:

$$\beta = \hbox{\hskip 100pt}$$

\underbar{file 02320}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\beta = {I_C \over I_B}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This definition may be found in any introductory electronics textbook, so you should ask you students to explain something about this formula in order to make it a meaningful discussion question.  Suitable explanations to request would be:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} What are some typical values for $\beta$?
\item{$\bullet$} Is $\beta$ always greater than 1 or less than 1?  What does this suggest about the two transistor currents in the formula?
\item{$\bullet$} What would the $\beta$ value be for an {\it ideal} transistor?
\medskip
