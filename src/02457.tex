Calculate the overall voltage gain of this amplifier circuit ($A_V$), both as a ratio and as a figure in units of decibels (dB).  Also, write a general equation for calculating the voltage gain of such an amplifier, given the resistor values of $R_1$ and $R_2$:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$A_V = 2 = 6.02$ dB 

$$A_V = {R_1 \over R_2} + 1 \hbox{\hskip 20pt (expressed as a ratio, not dB)}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain how you could modify this particular circuit to have a voltage gain (ratio) of 3 instead of 2.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing special here -- just some practice with voltage gain calculations.
