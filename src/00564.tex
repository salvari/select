What types of electrical systems pose a substantial threat of arc flash and arc blast?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Electrical power systems, particularly high-voltage (480 volts and above).  This is not to say that arc flash and arc blast cannot occur in systems of lesser voltage, but they are less likely to be as destructive.

Follow-up question: what types of job activities would likely bring a person into a situation where arc flash and arc blast are possible, or even likely?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Not all electrical systems harbor the danger of arc flash and arc blast, but many do.  While it may be obvious to some of your students that the small-scale electrical and electronic circuits they will be building in your course pose no threat of arc flash or arc blast, it is important to reassure the others that this is a hazard almost impossible to exist in a classroom environment.
