Explain what will happen to the first load's voltage and current in this voltage divider circuit, as a second load is connected as shown:

$$\epsfbox{01781x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01781}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Ideally, the first load's voltage and current will remain unaffected by the connection of load \#2 to the circuit.  In reality, there will inevitably be a slight sag in the load voltage though, because the voltage source is bound to have {\it some} internal resistance.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is important for students to realize that the second load constitutes a separate parallel branch in the circuit, which (ideally) has no effect on the rest of the circuit.
