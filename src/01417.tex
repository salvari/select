What is the purpose of a {\it seven-segment decoder} circuit?  What is a "seven-segment" display, and why do we need a decoder circuit to drive it?  Research the part number for a typical seven-segment decoder circuit (either CMOS or TTL).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Seven-segment displays are a very common numerical interface for digital electronic equipment:

A special decoder circuit is needed to translate 4-bit BCD codes into the particular combinations of segment activations that represent decimal digits.

Follow-up question: what does the internal schematic of a typical seven-segment display look like?  Is there just one type, or are there different types of seven-segment displays?

Be sure to ask your students to reveal the decoder datasheets they found.  Once again, manufacturer datasheets contain a wealth of information, and your students will learn much by researching them.
