%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Step-down transformers have fewer secondary turns than primary turns, while step-up transformers have more secondary turns than primary turns.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain the relationship between primary and secondary turns, and how this affects the voltage transformation ratio, based on mutual inductance.
