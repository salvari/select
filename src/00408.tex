If I wanted to build a battery-powered electric drill, would it be better to use {\it primary} cell batteries, or {\it secondary} cell batteries?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Secondary" cell batteries would be better to use for an application such as an electric drill, because it would be wasteful to have to discard so many primary-cell batteries at the rate they would be "consumed" powering such a device.

Basically, the point of this question is to get students to research what the difference is between a primary and a secondary cell.  Framing the question in a practical context makes it more interesting, and involves other practical issues as well (economics, conservation, etc.).
