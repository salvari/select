%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Being that pole-mounted power distribution transformers are exposed for anyone to look at, they provide an excellent opportunity for students to practice identifying three-phase connections.  If there are any such transformer configurations located near your campus, it would be an interesting field exercise to bring students there (or send them there on "field research"!) to identify the connections.  Photographs of transformer connections may also be used in the classroom to provide practical examples of this concept.
