%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "crowbar" circuit uses an SCR to clamp the output voltage of a DC power supply in the event of accidental overvoltage, in the same manner that a (literal) metal crowbar thrown across the terminals of a power supply would forcibly clamp the output voltage.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students whether or not they think a crowbar circuit is the sort of mechanism that sees regular use, or whether it is seldom activated.
