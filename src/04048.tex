%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "synchronous" counter circuit's flip-flops are clocked simultaneously, while each of the "asynchronous" counter circuit's flip-flops is clocked by the output of the preceding flip-flop.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to discuss what advantages, if any, one of these counter circuit types may have over the other.
