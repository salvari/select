This bridge circuit is suppose to generate an output voltage proportional to the {\it difference} between light exposure on the two photocells:

$$\epsfbox{00504x01.eps}$$

However something has failed in this circuit, because the voltmeter is "pegged" fully negative and will not change with varying light exposures on the two cells.  Identify at least two possible failures that could cause the voltmeter to over-range in the negative direction.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here are two failures, although they are not the only possibilities:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $R_1$ could have failed shorted.
\item{$\bullet$} Photocell $R_3$ could have failed open.
\medskip

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to ask your students to describe failures {\it other} than the two mentioned in the answer.  And, for all answers given, be sure to ask students how they determined those faults would cause the observed "negative pegging" of the voltmeter.  As usual, the method of solution is much more important than the actual answer in this question.
