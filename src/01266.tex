Field effect transistors are classified as {\it majority carrier} devices.  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Conduction through a field-effect transistor depends on charge carriers present in the channel due to doping (the "majority" type of charge carrier).

Review question: in contrast, why are bipolar junction transistors considered {\it minority carrier} devices?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what type of transistor operates on a {\it minority carrier} principle, as opposed to field-effect transistors.
