How much effect will a change in the op-amp's open-loop voltage gain have on the {\it overall} voltage gain of a negative-feedback circuit such as this?

$$\epsfbox{00929x01.eps}$$

If the open-loop gain of this operational amplifier were to change from 100,000 to 200,000, for example, how big of an effect would it have on the voltage gain as measured from the noninverting input to the output?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The different in overall voltage gain will be trivial.

Follow-up question: what advantage is there in building voltage amplifier circuits in this manner, applying negative feedback to a "core" amplifier with very high intrinsic gain?

Work with your students to calculate a few example scenarios, with the old open-loop gain versus the new open-loop gain.  Have the students validate their conclusions with numbers!

Negative feedback is an extremely useful engineering principle, and one that allows us to build very precise amplifiers using imprecise components.  Credit for this idea goes to Harold Black, an electrical engineer, in 1920's.  Mr. Black was looking for a way to improve the linearity and stability of amplifiers in telephone systems, and (as legend has it) the idea came to him in a flash of insight as he was commuting on a ferry boat.

An interesting historical side-note is that Black's 1928 patent application was initially rejected on the grounds that he was trying to submit a perpetual motion device!  The concept of negative feedback in an amplifier circuit was so contrary to established engineering thought at the time, that Black experienced significant resistance to the idea within the engineering community.  The United States patent office, on the other hand, was inundated with fraudulent "perpetual motion" claims, and so dismissed Black's invention at first sight.
