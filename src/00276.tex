What is meant by the {\it ampacity} rating of a wire?  What criteria establish the ampacity rating of any given wire?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The "ampacity" of a wire is its maximum rated current.  I won't tell you what criteria establish the ampacity rating of a wire, but I will say that you will find the characteristics of the insulation coating a wire has as much to do with a wire's ampacity as the physical characteristics of the metal itself!

Be sure to ask your students what resource(s) proved helpful in researching the answer to this question.  Being essentially a safety issue, there are several industry publications on electrical safety regulations that may prove informative.

This question connects several important principles together: physical ratings of materials, power dissipation in metallic conductors, and electrical safety.  Challenge your students to "connect" these principles on their own by probing their knowledge with follow-up questions.
