Explain why a circuit designer would choose a MOSFET over a bipolar transistor for a certain application.  What advantage(s) does a MOSFET have over a bipolar transistor?

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: prove your point by comparing parametric ratings from two transistor datasheets, one bipolar and the other an insulated-gate field effect.  Be sure these two transistors have similar controlled current ratings (maximum collector current and drain current, respectively).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

MOSFETs have extremely low input current "drive" requirements.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain what "drive current" means in terms of transistor ratings.  Also, ask them to explain {\it why} MOSFETs do not require as much drive current as bipolar transistors.  Challenge them to prove their point by a comparison of datasheets.

Is low drive current the only advantage that MOSFETs enjoy over bipolar transistors?  Pose this question to your students, to see if they investigated these respective devices any further than the question demanded.
