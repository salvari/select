Sketch the approximate waveform of this circuit's output signal ($V_{out}$) on the screen of the oscilloscope:

$$\epsfbox{03503x01.eps}$$

Hint: use the Superposition Theorem!

Follow-up question: explain why it is acceptable to use a polarized (polarity-sensitive) capacitor in this circuit when it is clearly connected to a source of AC.  Why is it not damaged by the AC voltage when used like this?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note that the capacitor size has been chosen for negligible capacitive reactance ($X_C$) at the specific frequency, such that the 10 k$\Omega$ DC bias resistors present negligible loading to the coupled AC signal.  This is typical for this type of biasing circuit.

Aside from giving students an excuse to apply the Superposition Theorem, this question previews a circuit topology that is extremely common in transistor amplifiers.
