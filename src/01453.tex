What would happen if a 10 $\mu$F capacitor, charged to a voltage of 6 volts, were connected to a completely discharged (0 volts) 22 $\mu$F capacitor?

$$\epsfbox{01453x01.eps}$$

What would the voltage(s) be across each capacitor, after enough time had passed for complete equalization to occur?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Voltage across each capacitor = 1.875 volts.
