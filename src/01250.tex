The following is an internal schematic of a TTL logic gate.  Based on your analysis of the transistor circuit, determine what type of gate (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.) it is:

$$\epsfbox{01250x01.eps}$$

Hint: the double-emitter transistor is being used as a pair of diodes, and not as an amplifying device!

$$\epsfbox{01250x02.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a NAND gate circuit.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

TTL circuits are actually quite easy to analyze compared to analog amplifier circuits!  Discuss with your students the use of a dual-emitter transistor as a "steering" diode network: this is a trick used by IC manufacturers, to obtain three diodes for the "price" of one transistor.
