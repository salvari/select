Pulse-density modulation (PDM) is closely related to pulse-width modulation (PWM).  Describe the similarities and differences in your own words.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

PWM is a truly analog modulation format, where PDM is truly digital.  In other words, the resolution of PWM is infinite, whereas the resolution of PDM is finite.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that either pulse stream may be converted into an analog voltage by low-pass filtering, which makes both of these modulation formats very useful.
