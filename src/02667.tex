Complete the schematic diagram showing how two 12-volt batteries would be connected together to form a "split" (+12/-12) power supply for this comparator circuit, and then trace the complete path of current when the LED is energized.  Ignore the comparator's input terminals in this circuit.  Just assume they are connected to sources of voltage appropriate for turning the LED on:
