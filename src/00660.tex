Calculate all voltages and all currents in this circuit, given the component values and the number of turns in each of the transformer's windings:

$$\epsfbox{00660x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$E_R =$ 750 V

$I_R =$ 340.9 mA

\vskip 5pt

$E_{source} =$ 50 V

$I_{source} =$ 5.114 A

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: given the voltage and current figures of the power source, how much impedance does it "think" it is driving?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question checks students' ability to relate the winding ratio to voltage and current ratios in a transformer circuit.  The symbolism here is common in Europe, but not so common in the United States.
