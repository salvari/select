If we were to apply a sinusoidal AC signal to the input of this transistor amplifier circuit, the output would definitely {\it not} be sinusoidal:

$$\epsfbox{00746x01.eps}$$

It should be apparent that only portions of the input are being amplified in this circuit.  The rest of the waveform seems to be "missing" in the output, being replaced by a flat line.  Explain why this transistor circuit is not able to amplify the entire waveform.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Transistors are essentially DC devices, not AC devices.  Consider the base-emitter PN junction that the input signal is sent to: it can only conduct in one direction (base positive and emitter negative).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Sometimes it is helpful for students to re-draw the circuit using a transistor model showing the base-emitter junction as a diode.  If you think this model would help some of your students understand the concept here, have another student draw the transistor model on the whiteboard, and use that drawing as a discussion aid.  Like any PN junction, the base-emitter junction of a BJT only "wants" to conduct current in one direction.
