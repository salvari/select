${\bf Z_{load}}$ = 541.7 $\Omega$ $\angle$ -54.77$^{o}$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to describe the effect of the transformer's step-up ratio on impedance magnitude and on impedance phase angle.  They may do this by comparing the impedance of the C-R-C circuit on the transformer's secondary side versus the impedance "seen" at the voltage source terminals.  Ask them to explain why one of these parameters is affected but the other is not.

Then, pose the scenario of a real transformer, complete with leakage inductance.  Ask your students to explain what effect would leakage inductance have on the load impedance of this circuit.
