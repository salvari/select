{\it Common-mode rejection ratio} is the ratio between a differential amplifier's differential voltage gain and its common-mode voltage gain:

$$\hbox{CMRR} = {A_{V(diff)} \over A_{V(CM)}}$$

The greater this parameter's value, the better the differential amplifier will perform as a truly {\it differential} amplifier.  Combine the equations for differential voltage gain and for common-mode voltage gain for the following differential amplifier circuit, into a single equation for CMRR:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\hbox{CMRR} \approx {R_E \over r'_e}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what component value(s) should be altered to maximize CMRR in a differential pair circuit, and why?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

You might want to add that CMRR is usually expressed in decibels, calculated the same way you would calculate decibels for any other ratio of voltages.
