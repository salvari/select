Write an equation describing the precise mathematical relationship between electric charge ($Q$), capacitance ($C$), and voltage ($V$).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

All I'll reveal here is that charge is directly proportional to both voltage {\it and} capacitance.  This equation is an easy one to find on your own, by researching through various electronics textbooks!

Follow-up question: calculate the amount of charge stored in a 330 $\mu$F capacitor charged with a voltage of 12 volts.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is one of those equations usually discussed somewhere in the first few months of basic electronics education, and promptly forgotten by most.  It can be very useful, however, when dealing with charge pumps and other switched-capacitor circuitry.
