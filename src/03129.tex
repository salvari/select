Use the Superposition Theorem to calculate the amount of current going through the 55 $\Omega$ heater element.  Ignore all wire and connection resistances, only considering the resistance of each fuse in addition to the heater element resistance:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{heater} =$ 4.439 A

Follow-up question: explain how you could use the Superposition Theorem to calculate current going through the short length of wire connecting the two generators together:

$$\epsfbox{03129x02.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Though there are other methods of analysis for this circuit, it is still a good application of Superposition Theorem.
