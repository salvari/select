The following comparator circuit was built by an avid kite flyer, who wanted a circuit to alert him to abnormal wind conditions.  Is this circuit configured to act as a {\it high} wind speed alarm, or a {\it low} wind speed alarm?  Also, show which way the potentiometer wiper would have to be moved in order to obtain a higher wind speed alarm point.
