%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here is a sample definition:

\vskip 10pt {\narrower \noindent \baselineskip5pt

An "oscillator" is a device that produces oscillations (back-and-forth) changes -- usually an electronic circuit that produces AC -- from a steady (DC) source of power.

I'll let you determine some practical oscillator applications on your own!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Oscillators are nearly ubiquitous in a modern society.  If your students' only examples are electronic in nature, you may want to mention these mechanical devices:

\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Pendulum clock mechanism
\item{$\bullet$} Shaker (for sifting granular materials or mixing liquids such as paint)
\item{$\bullet$} Whistle
\item{$\bullet$} Violin string
