How much electrical power is being dissipated by the light bulb in this circuit?

$$\epsfbox{00178x01.eps}$$

In this circuit, identify which component is the {\it source} and which is the {\it load}.

\underbar{file 00178}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

6.48 watts

\vskip 10pt

Here, the battery is the source and the light bulb is the load.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The solution to this problem simply requires the application of Ohm's Law.  As for the question of source versus load, ask your students to define each of these words in terms of energy transfer.

%INDEX% Joule's Law, quantitative
%INDEX% Source versus load
%INDEX% Load versus source
