%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order for students to answer this question, they must review the internal operation of an oscilloscope.  This does not have to be rigorous -- a block-diagram understanding is good enough.  The important thing is that they understand what the capacitor does for the oscilloscope input.  Once this is understood, students will have a much better understanding of {\it why} and {\it where} the coupling control is used.
