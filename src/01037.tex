Suppose you were handed a black box with two metal terminals on one side, for attaching electrical (wire) connections.  Inside this box, you were told, was a voltage source (an ideal voltage source connected in series with a resistance):

$$\epsfbox{01037x01.eps}$$

How would you experimentally determine the voltage of the ideal voltage source inside this box, and how would you experimentally determine the resistance of the series resistor?  By "experimentally," I mean determine voltage and resistance using actual test equipment rather than assuming certain component values (remember, this "black box" is sealed, so you cannot look inside!).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Measure the open-circuit voltage between the two terminals, and then measure the short-circuit current.  The voltage source's value is measured, while the resistor's value is calculated using Ohm's Law.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students how they would apply this technique to an abstract circuit problem, to reduce a complex network of sources and resistances to a single voltage source and single series resistance (Th\'evenin equivalent).
