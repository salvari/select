%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Each series LC section is a resonant band-pass filter, tuned to successive harmonics of a 60 Hz sine wave.  The selector switch enables a single voltmeter to measure the RMS amplitude of each harmonic.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: calculate the {\it exact} inductance values necessary for precise tuning of the five LC filters, for the first five harmonics of a 60 Hz waveform.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: the voltmeter in this circuit would not have to be a true-RMS meter.  It could simply be an average-responding (RMS-calibrated) voltmeter and it would work the same.  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question provides students with some review of passive filter circuit theory, as well as insight into a practical circuit they could conceivably build as a project.

A very important design feature of this circuit is the narrow bandwidth of each harmonic "channel."  The filter pass-bands must {\it not} come close to overlapping, or else the meter response will not be exclusively indicative of the harmonic it is switched to.  High Q values for each filter section ensure that the meter will {\it only} register the particular harmonic that is selected for measurement.
