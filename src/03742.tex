Suppose this regulated power supply circuit used to function fine, but now has stopped outputting any DC voltage at all:

$$\epsfbox{03742x01.eps}$$

Initial diagnostic measurements show there to be full DC (unregulated) voltage across capacitor $C_1$, and no DC voltage between the transistor base and ground.  From this data, where would you suspect the problem is?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Most likely $R_1$ failed open or the zener diode $D_5$ failed shorted, such that the transistor is not being "told" to output any voltage at its emitter terminal.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why the diagnostic measurements described in the question are good points to check (in the order that they were taken).
