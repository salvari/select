Suppose you needed a two-input AND gate, but happened to have an unused 3-input AND gate in one of the integrated circuits ("chips") already in the system you were building.  Of course, you could just add another IC containing 2-input AND gates, but it seems a shame to waste the 3-input gate already there.

Explain what you would need to do with the third input terminal on this gate in order to use it as a 2-input AND gate:

Now, explain what to do with each of the following gates' third inputs, in order to use each of them as 2-input gates:

$$\epsfbox{02948x02.eps}$$

In each case, describe why your solution works.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A helpful way for students to think about this question is to consider gates in terms of what input state {\it forces} the output to go to a particular state.  For example, AND gate outputs are forced low by any low input, therefore the unused input had better not be tied to ground -- the only remaining option is to tie it high.
