An AC load exhibits a lagging power factor of 0.71 at 440 VAC and 2.5 amps.  If the system frequency is 60 Hz, calculate the following:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Apparent power ($S$) =
\item{$\bullet$} True power ($P$) =
\item{$\bullet$} $\Theta$ =
\item{$\bullet$} Necessary parallel $C$ size to correct power factor to unity =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Apparent power ($S$) = 1.1 kVA
\item{$\bullet$} True power ($P$) = 781 W
\item{$\bullet$} $\Theta$ = 44.77$^{o}$
\item{$\bullet$} Necessary parallel $C$ size to correct power factor to unity = 10.61 $\mu$F
