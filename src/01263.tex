In TTL circuitry, one side of the DC power supply is usually labeled as "$V_{CC}$", while the other side is labeled as "$V_{EE}$".  Why is this?  What do the subscripts "CC" and "EE" represent?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{CC}$ = Power supplied to collector side of bipolar transistors.

$V_{EE}$ = Power supplied to emitter side of bipolar transistors.

Follow-up question: Since TTL circuits use NPN transistors exclusively, what polarities must each of these labels represent?

This question is a good review of bipolar junction transistor theory.
