Calculate the output voltage of this passive differentiator circuit 1 millisecond after the rising edge of each positive square wave pulse (where the square wave transitions from -5 volts to +5 volts):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out}$ = 2.82 volts @ 1 ms after rising edge

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is nothing more than an exercise in time-constant circuit calculations: determining how far the output voltage has decayed from its peak of 10 volts after 1 millisecond.  Ask your students to share their techniques for problem-solving with the whole class.
