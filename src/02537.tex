Calculate the necessary gain of the second-stage amplifier to give the whole circuit a voltage gain of 25 decibels, then translate all decibel figures into gain ratios:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Stage 1 gain = 18 dB = 7.94
\item{$\bullet$} Stage 2 gain = 7 dB = 2.24
\item{$\bullet$} Overall gain = 25 dB = 17.8
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is nothing more than "drill" for students to practice decibel/ratio conversions.
