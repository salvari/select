Suppose that the following audio tone control circuit has a problem: the first potentiometer ($R_{pot1}$) seems to act more like a plain volume control than a tone control.  Instead of adjusting the amount of bass heard at the headphones, it seems to adjust the volume of bass and treble tones alike:

$$\epsfbox{03509x01.eps}$$

What do you think might be wrong with this circuit?  Assuming it has been correctly designed and was working well for some time, what component or wire failure could possibly account for this behavior?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Most likely inductor $L_1$ has failed shorted.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students how this circuit functions before they offer their ideas for faulted components or wires.  One must understand the basic operating principle(s) of a circuit before one can troubleshoot it effectively!
