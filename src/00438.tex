When checked with an ohmmeter, how should a properly functioning capacitor respond?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "healthy" capacitor should register as an open circuit between its terminals, after the initial charging period.

Follow-up question: what do you suppose is the most likely failure "mode" of a capacitor, open or shorted?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students actually test a few capacitors with their ohmmeters in class.  For large capacitor values, the charging time may be substantial!  Students need to be aware of this, and the effect it has on the ohmmeter's indication.

Although an ohmmeter check of a capacitor is not a comprehensive analysis, it is certainly better than nothing, and will detect the more common faults.
