Write equations expressing each of the four "total" variables ($V_{total}$, $I_{total}$, $R_{total}$, and $P_{total}$) in a {\bf simple series circuit} with one voltage source and three load components.  Note that the fourth equation is already given to you as an example:

\vskip 10pt

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{total}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{total}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $R_{total}$ =
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

For a circuit variable that is equal for all components, write the equation in this form: 

$x_{total} = x_1 = x_2 = x_3$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{total} = I_1 = I_2 = I_3$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3$
