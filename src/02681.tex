Note the following logarithmic identities, using the "common" (base 10) logarithm:

$$\log 0.1 = -1$$

$$\log 0.01 = -2$$

$$\log 0.001 = -3$$

$$\log 0.0001 = -4$$

In the first equation, the numbers 0.1 and 1 were related together by the log function.  In the second equation, the numbers 0.01 and 2 were related together by the same log function, and so on.

Rewrite the four equations together in such a way that the same numbers are related to each other, but without writing "log".  In other words, represent the same mathematical relationships using some mathematical function other than the common logarithm function.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$10^{-1} = 0.1$$

$$10^{-2} = 0.01$$

$$10^{-3} = 0.001$$

$$10^{-4} = 0.0001$$
