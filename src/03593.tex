%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I recommend students use a normal regulated (voltage) power supply, adjusting the output voltage until the output current is at 4 mA.  1 k$\Omega$ resistors work well for this circuit, requiring only 6.4 volts from the power supply to achieve 4 mA total current.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
