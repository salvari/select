Trace the complete path of current through the fault (shown as a small resistor bridging the wire and the metal case of the heater) when the heater's switch is turned on, including the path of this current through the AC voltage source:

Also, label the three wires between the power source and the heater: {\it Hot}, {\it Neutral}, and {\it Ground}.
