Calculate the necessary values of $R_1$ and $R_2$ to limit the minimum and maximum voltage gain of this opamp circuit to 10 and 85, respectively:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1$ = 2 k$\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$R_2$ = 153 k$\Omega$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very practical example of using simultaneous equations in analog circuit design.  A common mistake students make while setting up the equations is forgetting that a noninverting amplifier's gain is the ratio of the feedback and grounding resistors, {\it plus one!}
