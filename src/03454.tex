Examine these two variable-resistance ({\it rheostat}) networks, each one with a large-range potentiometer and a small-range potentiometer:

$$\epsfbox{03454x01.eps}$$

For each network, determine which pot is the {\it coarse} adjustment and which pot is the {\it fine} adjustment for total resistance.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Series network}

100k = Coarse adjustment ; 5k = Fine adjustment

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Parallel network}

5k = Coarse adjustment ; 100k = Fine adjustment

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is for students to identify the dominant resistance values in series versus parallel circuits.  Remind your students if necessary that $R_{total} > R_n$ for series and $R_{total} < R_n$ for parallel (where $R_n$ represents any particular resistor in the network).
