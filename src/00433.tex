If we were to "model" a transistor with a standard passive component (resistor, voltage source, current source, capacitor, or inductor) for the sake of mathematically analyzing a circuit containing a transistor, what component would best represent the characteristics of the transistor within its "active" region?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A transistor within its "active" region would be best modeled by a {\it current source}.

If your students are perplexed at the method of determining the answer, ask them this question: "For the transistor, what variable remains {\it constant} despite a wide variation in the other variable?"
