No ground symbols are seen anywhere in the schematic diagram, yet there are "+V" and "-V" labels for the two poles of the DC power supply.  Where is ground in this circuit, and what establishes its potential?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The voltage divider circuit comprised of two 1 k$\Omega$ resistors establishes the ground point.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Of course, this circuit could have been built with a "split" supply of +V/Gnd/-V, but it is much easier to find or build a simple "single" power supply!
