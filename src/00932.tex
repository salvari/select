Calculate the output voltage of this op-amp circuit (using negative feedback):

$$\epsfbox{00932x01.eps}$$

Also, calculate the DC voltage gain of this circuit.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out} =$ -8.1 volts

\vskip 10pt

$A_V =$ 5.4 

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: the midpoint of the voltage divider (connecting to the inverting input of the op-amp) is often called a {\it virtual ground} in a circuit like this.  Explain why.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is important that students learn to analyze the op-amp circuit in terms of voltage drops and currents for each resistor, rather than just calculate the output using a gain formula.  Detailed, Ohm's Law analysis of op-amp circuits is essential for analyzing more complex circuitry.

The "virtual ground" question is an important one for the sake of rapid analysis.  Once students understand how and why there is such a thing as a "virtual ground" in an op-amp circuit like this, their analysis of op-amp circuits will be much more efficient.
