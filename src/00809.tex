If the ends of a wire loop are attached to two half-circular metal strips, arranged so that the two strips almost form a complete circle, and those strips are contacted by two "brushes" which connect to opposite poles of a battery, what polarity of voltage will be measured as the loop is rotated counter-clockwise?

Follow-up question: does the polarity measured at the two carbon brushes ever reverse?  Or, to phrase the question another way, if a resistor were connected between the two brush contacts, would it "see" direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC)?  Explain your answer.

Ask your students what the two half-circle metal strips are called, in electric motor/generator terminology.
