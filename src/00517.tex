A battery has an advertised capacity of 600 amp-hours, taken from tests performed over an 8-hour period (where capacity in amp-hours = $It$).  According to Peukert's formula, what rate of current discharge will result in the battery fully discharging in 3 hours (assume an $n$ value of 1.35)?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to calculate the amount of current predicted by the "simple" amp-hour equation for a discharge time of 3 hours.  In your students' estimation, which is a more realistic prediction, Peukert's formula or the amp-hour ($It$) formula?
