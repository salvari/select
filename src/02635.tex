How does the {\it quality factor} ($Q$) of a typical quartz crystal compare to that of a regular LC tank circuit, and what does this indicate about the frequency stability of crystal-controlled oscillators?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Q$ values of several {\it thousand} are commonplace with crystals, while $Q$ values in excess of 10 are considered good for LC tank circuits!

Note that I did not answer the frequency stability question, but left that for the students to figure out.
