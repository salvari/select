Determine the different range values of this multi-range voltmeter:

$$\epsfbox{00723x01.eps}$$

All components on the printed circuit board are "surface-mount," soldered onto the top surfaces of the copper traces.  The switch (SW1) schematic diagram is shown to the immediate right of the circuit board, with resistor values shown below the circuit board.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Ranges = 10 V, 25 V, and 50 V.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Determining the voltage ranges for this voltmeter is simply an exercise in Ohm's Law.  The arithmetic is simple enough to permit solution without the use of calculators, so challenge your students during discussion time to work through the math "the old-fashioned way".
