Some communications networks use cables to not only provide a path for data transmission, but also DC power to energize the circuits connected to the cable.

However, if we were to terminate the cable as shown, the termination resistor would dissipate a substantial amount of power.  This is wasted energy, and would unnecessarily burden the power supply providing DC power to the network cable.

How can we eliminate the problem of power dissipated by the termination resistor in a DC power/signal cable and yet still maintain proper termination to avoid reflected signals?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A capacitor must be connected in series with the termination resistance to prevent the resistance from acting as a DC load on the network:

Understanding this answer requires that students recall the filtering behavior of a series capacitor in an AC circuit.
