Special integrated circuits called {\it delay elements} or {\it delay gates} are manufactured to provide nanoseconds' worth of intentional time delays in digital circuits.  Identify a part number for such an IC, research its datasheet, and describe an application where one might be needed.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

One part number for you to research is 74LS31.  Such delay elements might be used to provide ample set-up and/or hold times for signals entering flip-flop.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why such devices exist, in light of the existence of 555 timers.  Why couldn't a 555 timer be used for the same purpose as the 74LS31?
