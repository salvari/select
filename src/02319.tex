%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Being able to design a circuit using a BJT as a switch is a valuable skill for technicians and engineers alike to have.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
