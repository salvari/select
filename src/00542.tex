Calculate the output voltages of these two voltage divider circuits (from point {\bf A} to ground, and from point {\bf B} to ground:

$$\epsfbox{00542x01.eps}$$

Now, calculate the voltage between points {\bf A} (red lead) and {\bf B} (black lead).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_A =$ + 65.28 V

$V_B =$ + 75.0 V

$V_{AB} =$ - 9.72 V

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In this question, I want students to see how the voltage between the two dividers' output terminals is the difference between their individual output voltages.  I also want students to see the notation used to denote the voltages (use of subscripts, with an applied reference point of ground).  Although voltage is {\it always and forever} a quantity between two points, it is appropriate to speak of voltage being "at" a single point in a circuit if there is an implied point of reference (ground).
