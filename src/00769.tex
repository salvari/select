Calculate the current in this circuit, and also the amount of mechanical power (in units of "horsepower") required to turn this alternator (assume 100\% efficiency):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I$ = 99.82 A

$P$ = 45.4 horsepower

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask students what each of the load components (inductor and resistor) do with the electrical energy delivered to them by the alternator.  The two components behave very differently with regard to power, and only one if them is dissipative.

%INDEX% Horsepower, conversion between watts
%INDEX% Power factor, effect on mechanical power needed to turn generator
