A DC electric motor spinning at 4500 RPM draws 3 amps of current with 110 volts measured at its terminals.  The resistance of the armature windings, measured with an ohmmeter when the motor is at rest, unpowered, is 2.45 ohms.  How much counter-EMF is the motor generating at 4500 RPM?

How much "inrush" current will there be when the motor is initially powered up (armature speed = 0 RPM), once again assuming 110 volts at the terminals?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$E_{counter} = 102.65$ V @ 4500 RPM

$I_{inrush} = 44.9$ A

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This calculation helps students realize just how significant the "inrush" current of an electric motor is.
