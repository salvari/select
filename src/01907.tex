Suppose an oscilloscope has been set up to display a triangle wave:

$$\epsfbox{01907x01.eps}$$

The horizontal position knob is then turned clockwise until the left-hand edge of the waveform is visible:

$$\epsfbox{01907x02.eps}$$

Now, the point at which the waveform triggers is clearly visible, no longer hidden from view past the left-hand side of the screen:

$$\epsfbox{01907x03.eps}$$

What will happen now if the trigger level knob is turned clockwise?  How will this affect the positioning of the waveform on the oscilloscope screen?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The waveform will shift to the left as the trigger level is raised:

$$\epsfbox{01907x04.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There is nothing special about a triangle wave here.  To be perfectly honest, it was the easiest waveform for me to draw which had a sloping edge to trigger on!

By the way, for students to really understand how triggering works, it is important for them to spend time "playing" with an oscilloscope and a signal generator trying things like this.  There is only so much one can learn about the operation of a machine by reading!
