Find one or two real switches and bring them with you to class for discussion.  Identify as much information as you can about your switches prior to discussion:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Number of poles
\item{$\bullet$} Number of throws
\item{$\bullet$} Voltage rating of contacts
\item{$\bullet$} Current rating of contacts
\item{$\bullet$} Contact status for various actuator positions
\item{$\bullet$} Type (toggle, pushbutton)

If possible, find a manufacturer's datasheet for your components (or at least a datasheet for a similar component) to discuss with your classmates.

The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter.  It may seem silly to have students engage in a "show and tell" exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students.  For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually {\it touch} real components while they're learning about their function.  Of course, this question also provides an excellent opportunity for them to practice interpreting component markings, poles and throws, use a multimeter, access datasheets, etc.
