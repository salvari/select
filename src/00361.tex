Some ohmmeters have a range where the measurement is expressed in units of {\it siemens} (usually {\it micro}siemens, or $\mu$S).  What is a "siemens," and how does it relate to the unit of the "ohm"?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The unit of the "siemens" is a measurement of {\it conductance}, the reciprocal of {\it resistance}:

$$G = {1 \over R}$$

\noindent
Where,

$G = $ conductance, in siemens

$R = $ resistance, in ohms

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what was the old unit for conductance, prior to the siemens?  You will find it makes more sense than siemens, just as the old metric unit of temperature ("centigrade") makes more sense than the new unit (celsius).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students, "is 1 microsiemens equivalent to a large resistance or a small resistance?"  Have them explain their answer, without using a calculator.
