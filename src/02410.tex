Explain how the one toggle switch is able to switch {\it both} transistors on and off simultaneously in this motor control circuit:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The switch exerts direct control over the lower transistor, which then indirectly turns on the upper transistor.  When both transistors are turned on, the motor runs.

This question is really a precursor to analyzing the H-bridge motor drive circuit.
