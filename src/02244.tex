The following graph is a family of characteristic curves for a particular transistor:

$$\epsfbox{02244x01.eps}$$

Draw the load line and identify the Q-point on that load line for a common-collector amplifier circuit using this transistor:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02244x03.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: the position of this circuit's Q-point is approximately mid-way along the load line.  Would you say this is indicative of an amplifier biased for Class A operation, or for some other class of operation?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to relate their existing knowledge of common-collector circuit DC analysis to the concept of load lines and Q-points.  Ask your students to share their analysis techniques with the whole class.
