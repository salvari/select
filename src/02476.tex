Determine the type (LP, HP, BP, BS) and cutoff frequency of this active filter circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02476x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02476}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a low-pass filter circuit.

$f_{-3dB}$ = 7.95 kHz

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain what the purpose of the 9.1 k$\Omega$ feedback resistor is, since all we're using the opamp for is a voltage buffer anyway (which theoretically does not require resistance in the feedback loop).  Furthermore, explain how the Superposition theorem is used to determine the optimum value of this feedback resistance.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how they arrived at their answers: what formulae did they use, and how did they determine the type of the filter circuit that this is?  Ask them if there was any information given in the diagram irrelevant to either determination.
