This is an interesting application of a transformer: 

$$\epsfbox{00754x01.eps}$$

With this circuit, power to the AC load may be controlled by the variable resistor's setting:

$$\epsfbox{00754x01.eps}$$

Calculate the amount of series impedance the transformer places in the load current's path, if the variable resistor is set to a resistance of 15 ohms, and the winding ratio is 20:1.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

0.0375 $\Omega$

Follow-up question identify any potential safety hazards associated with using a transformer in this capacity.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to think of a practical application for a circuit like this.  Also, challenge them with this question: if the resistor were to open fully ($\infty$ ohms), would current to the load completely stop?  Why or why not?
