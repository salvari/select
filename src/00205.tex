Calculate the total capacitance in this collection of capacitors, as measured between the two wires:

$$\epsfbox{00205x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00205}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

132.998 pF

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: suppose one of the terminal block's hold-down screws were to come loose on one of the leads for the middle capacitor, making a bad (open) connection.  What effect would this have on the total capacitance?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is most helpful to first draw a schematic diagram for this capacitor network before trying to perform any capacitance calculations, in order that a clear understanding of the series/parallel connections be established.
