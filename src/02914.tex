Many types of logic gate circuits are built with more than two inputs.  These are useful, even necessary, in some digital circuit applications.  Research the part numbers and datasheets of the following logic gate integrated circuits:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Triple 3-input NOR gate
\item{$\bullet$} Dual 4-input AND gate
\item{$\bullet$} Single 8-input NAND gate
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

It would be far too easy for you to look here for the answers!  Research the website of a digital IC manufacturer, or consult a reference book, to find the part numbers and datasheets you're looking for.  Be prepared to show at least one datasheet for class discussion.

If you haven't already, ask your students to provide a sample truth table for any of these gates.
