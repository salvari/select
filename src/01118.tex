Suppose two engineers were debating where to place a potentiometer in this audio amplifier circuit, to be used as a volume control:

$$\epsfbox{01118x01.eps}$$

Which option would be better, and why?  What ill effects could result from locating the potentiometer in the wrong place in this circuit?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Option \#1 is definitely the better choice, because the potentiometer's setting will not affect the biasing of $Q_2$ as it would in option \#2.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to make students realize that the biasing of each transistor stage is important in a multi-stage amplifier.  One of the major challenges of designing a multi-stage amplifier is to ensure adequate signal coupling between stages without creating bias problems.
