This inductive lamp-dimmer circuit used to work just fine but now it has a problem: the lamp refuses to energize, no matter what is done with the switch or the dimmer knob (on the variable inductor).

$$\epsfbox{03574x01.eps}$$

Turning the switch "on" and moving the dimmer knob to the "bright" position, you test for AC voltage between terminals {\bf E} and {\bf D} with a voltmeter and get 117 volts AC.  Based on this information, determine the following:

\vskip 10pt

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} \underbar{Two} components or wires in the circuit that you know cannot be failed either open or shorted.
\vskip 40pt
\item{$\bullet$} \underbar{One} component or wire in the circuit you think could possibly be failed, and which test points you would measure between with your voltmeter to check it.

\goodbreak
\noindent
{\bf Components known to be in good working condition:}

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Power plug
\item{$\bullet$} Wires from plug to terminals {\bf B}, {\bf D}
\item{$\bullet$} Fuse
\item{$\bullet$} Switch
\item{$\bullet$} Wires between fuse and terminals {\bf A}, {\bf B}
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf Possible component/wire fault and place to test:}

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Open inductor (indicated by voltage between {\bf E} and {\bf G} or absence of voltage between {\bf G} and {\bf D})
\item{$\bullet$} Open lamp (indicated by voltage between {\bf J} and {\bf L})
\item{$\bullet$} Open ({\it name any wire or component from {\bf E} to the lamp to {\bf D}}), indicated by voltage between nearest terminals
