Write an approximate equation describing the {\it differential} voltage gain for a differential pair circuit such as this, in terms of the component values:

$$\epsfbox{03923x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 03923}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$A_{V(diff)} = {R_C \over 2r'_e}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what component value(s) should be altered to maximize differential voltage gain in a differential pair circuit, and why?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to have students apply the Superposition theorem to combine two voltage gain equations into a single {\it differential} voltage gain equation.
