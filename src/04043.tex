Calculate the resonant frequency of this parallel LC circuit, and qualitatively describe its total impedance ($Z_{total}$) when operating at resonance:

$$\epsfbox{04043x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 04043}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f_r$ = 6.195 kHz

\vskip 10pt

$Z_{total}$ @ $f_r$ = $\infty$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing special to note here, just an application of the resonance formula and a review of parallel LC resonance.
