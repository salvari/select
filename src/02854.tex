I'll leave this part up to you!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Not only will a discrete transistor have a wider voltage range it can operate over (compared to a logic gate), but it is a good review of transistor circuit theory and a practical example of implementing a simple logic function without the benefit of integrated circuits.
