Examine the following audio tone control circuit, used to control the balance of bass and treble heard at the headphones from an audio source such as a radio or CD player:

$$\epsfbox{03507x01.eps}$$

Suppose that after working just fine for quite a long while, suddenly no more bass tones were heard through the headphones.  Identify at least two component or wiring faults that could cause this to happen.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here are some possibilities:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $R_1$ failed open
\item{$\bullet$} $R_{pot1}$ failed open
\item{$\bullet$} $L_1$ failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Open wire connections between any of the above listed components
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The circuit shown in the question is not very practical for direct headphone use, unless low-value resistors are used.  Otherwise, the losses are too great and maximum volume suffers.  An improvement over the original circuit is one where a matching transformer is used to effectively increase the impedance of the headphones:
