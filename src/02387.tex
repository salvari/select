Suppose we only knew the emitter and base currents for an operating transistor and wished to calculate $\beta$ from that information.  We would need a definition of beta cast in terms of $I_E$ and $I_B$ instead of $I_C$ and $I_B$.

Apply algebraic substitution to the formula $\beta = {I_C \over I_B}$ so that beta ($\beta$) is defined in terms of $I_E$ and $I_B$.  You may find the following equation helpful in your work:

$$I_E = I_C + I_B$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\beta = {I_E \over I_B} - 1$$

This question is nothing more than an exercise in algebraic manipulation.
