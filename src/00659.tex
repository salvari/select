In each of these circuits, calculate the amount of load impedance "seen" by the voltage sources given the turns ratio of each transformer:

Hint: "impedance" ($Z$) is defined mathematically as the ratio of voltage ($E$) to current ($I$).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The setup of this problem may confuse some students, with reference to the amount of impedance that a source "sees".  Hopefully, the anthropomorphic language will not be a barrier to understanding.  The point is, for students to realize that just as a load can have a voltage or a current "impressed" upon it, a source can have a load "impressed" upon it as well.  In this particular question, the issue is how the 1:2 step-down transformer ratio affects the amount of loading impressed upon the 240 VAC source by the 30 ohm resistor.  That the resistor "sees" the same source voltage should be obvious.  That the sources see very different impedance loadings (due to the transformer) is the purpose of this question.
