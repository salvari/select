Use Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to calculate the magnitude and polarity of the voltage across resistor $R_4$ in this resistor network:

In your discussion, be sure to explore more than one "loop" when using KVL.  Not only does this demonstrate the arbitrary nature of your loop choice, but it also serves as a double-check for your work!

It is not necessary to know anything about series-parallel or even parallel circuits in order to solve the $R_4$'s voltage -- all one needs to know is how to use Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.
