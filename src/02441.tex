Calculate the approximate amount of AC voltage output by this common-collector amplifier circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02441x01.eps}$$

Also, determine a signal frequency value that yields less than 1 ohm of reactance for each of the two coupling capacitors.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out} \approx$ 2.5 volts peak or 1.77 volts RMS (assuming a sinusoidal source).  A signal frequency of 3.39 kHz or greater will ensure the capacitive reactances will remain less than 1 ohm each.

Follow-up question: calculate the approximate (average) DC voltage dropped across the 1 k$\Omega$ emitter resistor.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should know the AC voltage gain of this amplifier configuration to be approximately 1, so the output voltage calculation should be trivial.  This question is really a test to see whether or not students are able to apply their knowledge of voltage gain to a specific application.
