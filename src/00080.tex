What do you think might happen if someone were to gently tap on the cone of one of these speakers?  What would the other speaker do?  In terms of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction, explain what is happening.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Try this experiment yourself, using a long pair of wires to separate the two speakers from each other by a significant distance.  Listen and feel the speaker on your end while someone else taps on the other speaker, then trade roles.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Not only does this experiment illustrate the dual principles of electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction, but it also demonstrates how easy it is to set up a simple sound-powered audio telephony system.

It is highly recommended to have an identical pair of "woofer" speakers located in the classroom for this experiment, as well as a long length of twin-wire cable (an old piece of extension cord wire works well for this purpose, with alligator-clip "jumper" wires to make the connections).
