%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The function generator is faulty.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain how this problem could be created simply by connecting the function generator to the circuit with the ground on the left-hand clip instead of the right-hand clip where it should be.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question challenges students to apply their knowledge of AC+DC mixed signals to oscilloscope display patterns, in order to determine whether it is the battery or the function generator which has failed.
