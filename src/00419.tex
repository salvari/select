The lines of a three-phase power system may be connected to the terminals of a three-phase motor in several different ways.  Which of these altered motor connections will result in the motor reversing direction?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Examples \#1 and \#3 will reverse the motor's rotation (as compared to the original wiring).  Example \#2 will not.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is helpful to review the concept of phase rotation sequences as a string of letters: A-B-C, or C-B-A.  Although these two letter sequences are the most common for denoting the two different rotation directions, they are not the only sequences possible using three letters.  For example, A-C-B, B-A-C, C-A-B, and B-C-A are also possibilities.  Discuss with your students which of these letter sequences represents the same {\it direction} of rotation as A-B-C, and which represent the same direction of rotation as C-B-A.  Then, ask your students how they might apply these letter sequences to the different wiring diagrams shown in the question.
