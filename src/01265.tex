Bipolar junction transistors are classified as {\it minority carrier} devices.  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Conduction through a BJT depends on charge carriers being "injected" into the base layer of the transistor, and these charge carriers are always the "minority" type with respect to the doping of the base.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note to your students that there is such a thing as a {\it majority carrier} type of transistor, but that it does not resemble the BJT in either construction or operational characteristics.
