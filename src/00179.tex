Calculate the amount of power dissipated by this electric heating element, if the generator's output voltage is 110 volts and the heater's resistance is 2.5 ohms:

$$\epsfbox{00179x01.eps}$$

Now, calculate the power dissipated by the same heater if the generator's output voltage is doubled.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

4,840 watts at 110 volts; 19,360 watts at 220 volts.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Many students will mistakenly calculate 9,680 watts as the power dissipation at 220 volts.  However, power dissipation does not increase linearly with increases in voltage!
