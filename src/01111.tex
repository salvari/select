Describe what happens to the shape of the load voltage waveform when the potentiometer is adjusted in this clipper circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01111x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01111}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The potentiometer adjusts the threshold at which the positive peak of the AC waveform is clipped.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: modify this circuit to function as a variable {\it negative} peak clipper instead.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may ask what this mathematical statement means:

$$R_{load} >> R_{series}$$

Explain to them that the "double-chevron" symbol means "{\it much} greater than" (reversing the chevrons would mean "much less than," of course).
