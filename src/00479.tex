Write an algebraic equation that solves for the voltage between the two bus conductors, based on the problem-solving method of Th\'evenin-to-Norton conversion, combining Norton sources into one, and combining resistors into one:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$V_{total} = {{V_1 \over R_1} + {V_2 \over R_2} + {V_3 \over R_3} \over {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + {1 \over R_3}}$$

At first it may seem a bit overwhelming to derive an equation from these steps, but it is actually easier than it looks.  A hint on how to do it: begin with the last step of the circuit simplification process, and work {\it backwards} as you elaborate your equation.
