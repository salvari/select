When potentiometers are used as variable resistors ({\it rheostats}), the unused terminal is often connected to the wiper terminal:

$$\epsfbox{00343x01.eps}$$

Explain what advantage is gained by connecting the wiper to the unused terminal.  Why is the lower potentiometer connection scheme more commonly used than the upper?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here is a hint: suppose the potentiometer becomes worn with use, to the point where the wiper occasionally loses electrical contact with the resistive element.  How would these two connection schemes compare, then?

This is an example of "defensive engineering": designing something with eventual failure in mind, with the goal of minimizing the consequences of that inevitable failure.  Whether your students go on to become engineers, or simply technicians, it is important for them to think past the immediate application and design issues, to consider what may happen as their system ages.
