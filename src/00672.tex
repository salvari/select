What does it mean to speak of the {\it gain} of a circuit?  This term is very commonly used when describing amplifier circuits, but it may also be used to describe circuits containing nothing but passive components, and are thus incapable of amplifying.

What letter is used to symbolize gain in mathematical equations?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Gain" ($A$) refers to the ratio of output signal compared to input signal.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss what it means for a circuit to have a designated "output" and "input".  Can they think of any circuits studied thus far that have places to input and output signals?
