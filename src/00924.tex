How much voltage would have to be "dialed up" at the potentiometer in order to stabilize the output at exactly 0 volts, assuming the opamp has no input offset voltage?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is a basic review of an ideal differential amplifier's function.  Ask your students what voltage must be "dialed up" at the potentiometer to produce 0 volts at the output of the op-amp for several different voltages at the other input.  If they don't understand at first, they soon will after discussing these alternate scenarios.
