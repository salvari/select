Qualitatively determine the voltages across all components as well as the current through all components in this simple RC circuit at three different times: (1) just before the switch closes, (2) at the instant the switch contacts touch, and (3) after the switch has been closed for a long time.  Assume that the capacitor begins in a completely discharged state:

$$\epsfbox{01811x01.eps}$$

Express your answers qualitatively: "maximum," "minimum," or perhaps "zero" if you know that to be the case.

{\bf Before the switch closes:}

$V_{R}$ =

Hint: a graph may be a helpful tool for determining the answers!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Before the switch closes:}

$V_{C}$ = zero

$V_{R}$ = zero

$V_{switch}$ = maximum

$I$ = zero

\vskip 10pt
\goodbreak

\noindent
{\bf At the instant of switch closure:}

$V_{C}$ = zero

$V_{R}$ = maximum

$V_{switch}$ = zero

$I$ = maximum

\vskip 10pt
\goodbreak

\noindent
{\bf Long after the switch has closed:}

$V_{C}$ = maximum

$V_{R}$ = zero

$V_{switch}$ = zero

$I$ = zero

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: which of these variables remained the same immediately before and immediately after switch closure?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to preview the concept of "initial" and "final" values in RC circuits, before they learn to use the "universal time constant formula."
