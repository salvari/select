\centerline{NAME: \underbar{\hskip 80pt} \hskip 40pt  {\bf Project Grading Criteria}  \hskip 40pt PROJECT: \underbar{\hskip 80pt}}

You will receive the highest score for which {\it all} criteria are met.

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{100 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed all criteria listed)}
\item{A.} Impeccable craftsmanship, comparable to that of a professional assembly
\item{B.} No spelling or grammatical errors anywhere in {\it any} document, upon first submission to instructor

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{95 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 90\% and below)}
\item{A.} Technical explanation sufficiently detailed to teach from, inclusive of every component (supersedes 75.B)
\item{B.} Itemized parts list complete with part numbers, manufacturers, and (equivalent) prices for {\it all} components, including recycled components and parts kit components (supersedes 90.A)

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{90 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 85\% and below)}
\item{A.} Itemized parts list complete with prices of components purchased for the project, plus total price
\item{B.} No spelling or grammatical errors anywhere in {\it any} document upon final submission

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{85 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 80\% and below)}
\item{A.} ``User's guide'' to project function (in addition to 75.B)
\item{B.} Troubleshooting log describing all obstacles overcome during development and construction

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{80 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 75\% and below)}
\item{A.} All controls (switches, knobs, etc.) clearly and neatly labeled
\item{B.} All documentation created on computer, not hand-written (including the schematic diagram)

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{75 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 70\% and below)}
\item{A.} Stranded wire used wherever wires are subject to vibration or bending
\item{B.} Basic technical explanation of all major circuit sections
\item{C.} Deadline met for working prototype of circuit (Date/Time = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} / \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \hskip 1pt)

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{70 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 65\%)}
\item{A.} All wire connections sound (solder joints, wire-wrap, terminal strips, and lugs are all connected properly)
\item{B.} No use of glue where a fastener would be more appropriate
\item{C.} Deadline met for submission of fully-functional project (Date/Time = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} / \underbar{\hskip 50pt} \hskip 1pt) -- supersedes 75.C if final project submitted by that (earlier) deadline

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{65 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to all criteria for 60\%)}
\item{A.} Project fully functional
\item{B.} All components securely fastened so nothing is ``loose'' inside the enclosure
\item{C.} Schematic diagram of circuit

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{60 \%} {\it (Must meet or exceed these criteria in addition to being safe and legal)}
\item{A.} Project minimally functional, with all components located inside an enclosure (if applicable)
\item{B.} Passes final safety inspection (proper case grounding, line power fusing, power cords strain-relieved)

\vskip 15pt

\goodbreak
\noindent
\underbar{0 \%} {\it (If \underbar{any} of the following conditions are true)}
\item{A.} Fails final safety inspection (improper grounding, fusing, and/or power cord strain relieving)
\item{B.} Intended project function poses a safety hazard
\item{C.} Project function violates any law, ordinance, or school policy

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Be sure you meet with your instructor if you have any questions about what is expected for your project!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this assessment rubric is to act as a sort of ``contract'' between you (the instructor) and your student.  This way, the expectations are all clearly known in advance, which goes a long way toward disarming problems later when it is time to grade.
