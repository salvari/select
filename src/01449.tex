\item{$\bullet$} ROM: {\it Read-Only Memory}
\item{$\bullet$} PROM: {\it Programmable Read-Only Memory}
\item{$\bullet$} EPROM: {\it Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory}
\item{$\bullet$} EEPROM: {\it Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory}
\item{$\bullet$} UVEPROM: {\it UltraViolet Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory}
\medskip
