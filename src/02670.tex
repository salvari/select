How many degrees of phase shift must the feedback circuit (the square box in this schematic) introduce to the signal in order for this noninverting amplifier circuit to oscillate?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The feedback network in this circuit must provide 360 degrees of phase shift, in order to sustain oscillations.  

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain why the feedback network must provide 180 degrees of phase shift to the signal.  Ask them to explain how this requirement relates to the need for {\it regenerative} feedback in an oscillator circuit.
