All other factors being equal, which amplifier requires less input signal {\it current} to drive, one built with a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) or one built with a JFET?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

JFET amplifiers draw less input current, because their gate-channel PN junctions are reverse-biased and therefore exhibit very high impedance.
