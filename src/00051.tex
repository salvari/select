How is it possible to assign a fixed value of voltage or current (such as "120 volts") to an AC electrical quantity that is constantly changing, crossing 0 volts, and reversing polarity?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

We may express quantities of AC voltage and current in terms of {\it peak}, {\it peak-to-peak}, {\it average}, or {\it RMS}.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Before you discuss "RMS" values with your students, it is important to cover the basic idea of how to assign fixed values to quantities that change over time.  Since AC waveforms are {\it cyclic} (repeating), this is not as difficult to do as one might think.
