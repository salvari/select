Calculate the current in this circuit, and also the amount of mechanical power (in units of "horsepower") required to turn this alternator (assume 100\% efficiency):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I$ = 141.18 A

$P$ = 0 horsepower, so long as the inductor is "pure" (100 percent inductance, with no resistance).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer to this question will surprise many of your students, because they are accustomed to calculating power simply by multiplying voltage by current ($P = I E$).

Ask your students how they calculated line current in this circuit, and then challenge them with the question of how 0 watts of power can be dissipated in this circuit with all this current and all this voltage (480 volts).

%INDEX% Horsepower, conversion between watts
%INDEX% Power factor, effect on mechanical power needed to turn generator
