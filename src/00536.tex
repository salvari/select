The core of an analog oscilloscope is a special type of vacuum tube known as a {\it Cathode Ray Tube}, or {\it CRT}.  While similar in function to the CRT used in televisions, oscilloscope display tubes are specially built for the purpose of serving an a measuring instrument.

Explain how a CRT functions.  What goes on inside the tube to produce waveform displays on the screen?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some of your students may come across photographs and illustrations of CRTs for use in their presentation.  If at all possible, provide a way for individual students to share their visual findings with their classmates, through the use of an overhead projector, computer monitor, or computer projector.  Discuss in detail the operation of a CRT with your students, especially noting the electrostatic method of electron beam deflection used to "steer" the beam to specific areas on the screen.
