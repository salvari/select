Shown here are three different telegraph circuits.  Determine which of these could be classified as {\it simplex}, {\it full-duplex}, and {\it half-duplex}, in terms of serial data transmission:

$$\epsfbox{01284x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{01284x02.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{01284x03.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01284}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Simplex: one-way communication
\item{$\bullet$} Half-duplex: two-way communication, one way at a time.
\item{$\bullet$} Full-duplex: two-way communication, both ways simultaneously.
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: trace all currents in these circuits using conventional flow, and then electron flow.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I could have just asked for definitions here, but relating these concepts to real circuits, however simple, carries with it more educational benefit.  It is also important to show students that the basic concept of digital communication is really no more complex than the old telegraph, just faster.
