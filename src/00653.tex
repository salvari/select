%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Nonlinear loads.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

My answer to this question is intentionally vague.  It is correct, but does not reveal anything about the real nature of the cause, or more importantly, {\it why} a "nonlinear" load would cause harmonics.  Discuss with your students what a "nonlinear" device is, and what it does to a sinusoidal signal to generate harmonics.
