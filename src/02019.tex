Shown here is the characteristic curve of a diode:

$$\epsfbox{02019x01.eps}$$

Identify which area of this curve represents normal forward-biased operation, and which represents reverse-biased operation.  Also, explain the significance of the near-vertical portion of the curve in the lower-left quadrant of the graph.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02019x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: identify where the diode's {\it reverse saturation current} may be found on this graph.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to identify the region of the curve described by Shockley's diode equation.  The exponential form of that equation really only models one definite portion of the curve!
