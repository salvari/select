Calculate the following parameters in this current-regulator circuit (all voltages measured with respect to ground):

$$\epsfbox{03947x01.eps}$$

$V_{TP1}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{TP5}$ =

\vskip 10pt

$I_{load}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{TP6}$ =

\underbar{file 03947}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{TP1}$ = 5.2 V \hskip 80pt $V_{TP5}$ = 5.2 V

\vskip 10pt

$I_{load}$ = 11.06 mA \hskip 80pt $V_{TP6}$ = 10.95 V
