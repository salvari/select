%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

For an object to be electrically {\it charged}, it must have either a surplus or a deficit of electrons among its atoms.  

A common example of electrically charging objects is rubbing latex balloons against wool clothing, or brushing your hair with a plastic comb.  The consequences of these electric charges are very easy to perceive!

This question naturally leads to a discussion on atomic theory.  Encourage your students to discuss and explore simple models of the atom, and how they serve to explain electricity in terms of electron placement and motion.
