%(BEGIN_NOTES)

NEC code books are rather large, so students may feel inclined to limit their answers to what is included in the "Answer" for this question.  However, you should challenge them to look deeper into an NEC book and discover the wealth of information contained therein. 

Specifically, ask them to describe some of the "Article" topics typically found in an NEC book.
