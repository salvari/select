There is a problem with this clipper circuit, as evidenced by the output waveform:

$$\epsfbox{01114x01.eps}$$

What is the most likely cause of this problem, and how would you verify your conclusion with further measurements?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The diode might be failed open, but this is only one possibility.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students figured out any other possibilities for the fault in this circuit?  They do exist, and in fact may be more likely than a failed-open diode!  Ask your students how and why they chose the answer they did, and be sure to have them explain their follow-up diagnostic procedures.
