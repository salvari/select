Suppose a technician measures the voltage output by an AC-DC power supply circuit:

$$\epsfbox{00539x01.eps}$$

The waveform shown by the oscilloscope is mostly DC, with just a little bit of AC "ripple" voltage appearing as a ripple pattern on what would otherwise be a straight, horizontal line.  This is quite normal for the output of an AC-DC power supply. 

Suppose we wished to take a closer view of this "ripple" voltage.  We want to make the ripples more pronounced on the screen, so that we may better discern their shape.  Unfortunately, though, when we decrease the number of volts per division on the "vertical" control knob to magnify the vertical amplification of the oscilloscope, the pattern completely disappears from the screen!

Explain what the problem is, and how we might correct it so as to be able to magnify the ripple voltage waveform without having it disappear off the oscilloscope screen.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The problem is that the vertical axis input is DC-coupled.

Follow-up question: predict the {\it frequency} of the ripple voltage in this power supply circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

As usual, what I'm looking for in an answer here is an {\it explanation} for what is happening.  If a student simply tells you, "the vertical input is DC-coupled," press them for more detail.  What does it mean for the input to be "DC-coupled," and why does this cause the line to disappear from the screen when we increase the vertical sensitivity?  What alternative do we have to "DC coupling" on an oscilloscope?

One nice thing about oscilloscopes is that they cannot be damaged by "pegging" the display, as can analog multimeters.  The same concept applies, though, and is useful in explaining to students why waveforms disappear from the screen when the vertical sensitivity is too great.
