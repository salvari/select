The equivalence between NAND gates and Negative-OR gates is something easily verified by an examination of these two gates' respective truth tables, and is often a starting-point for learning about DeMorgan's Theorem:

$$\epsfbox{03982x01.eps}$$

A lesser-known fact is how the equivalence between NAND and Negative-OR gates may be transformed to express an equivalence between two other types of gates, shown here:

$$\epsfbox{03982x02.eps}$$

Another example is shown here:

$$\epsfbox{03982x03.eps}$$

Explain how the first equivalence (between the NAND and the Negative-OR gate) was transformed into the latter two equivalences, both in terms of the gate symbols and their respective Boolean expressions.  In other words, explain {\it how} we can derive the last two examples by manipulating the first example.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a lot like algebraically manipulating equations: doing the exact same thing to both sides of an equation to arrive at a new equation that is more useful to us.  I'll let you figure out the details of how this is done.

This question is a precursor to having students create combinational gate circuits using nothing but NAND or NOR gates.
