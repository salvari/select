%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The voltage divider would have to altered so as to send a smaller proportion of the output voltage to the inverting input.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how they would modify the voltage divider in this circuit to achieve the goal of a smaller voltage division ratio.  This should be trivial, but it is always good to review basic principles of electricity even when "deep" into a more advanced topic.
