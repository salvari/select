%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The real circuit you build will validate your circuit design.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a four-pole, unipolar stepper motor for this assessment, with a power supply capable of sourcing the required current.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
