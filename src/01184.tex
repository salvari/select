The circuit shown here is a precision DC voltmeter:

$$\epsfbox{01184x01.eps}$$

Explain why this circuit design requires the use of a field-effect transistor, and not a bipolar junction transistor (BJT).

\vskip 10pt

Also, answer the following questions about the circuit:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Explain, step by step, how an increasing input voltage between the test probes causes the meter movement to deflect further.
\item{$\bullet$} If the most sensitive range of this voltmeter is 0.1 volts (full-scale), calculate the other range values, and label them on the schematic next to their respective switch positions.
\item{$\bullet$} What type of JFET configuration is this (common-gate, common-source, or common-drain)?
\item{$\bullet$} What purpose does the capacitor serve in this circuit?
\item{$\bullet$} What detrimental effect would result from installing a capacitor that was too large? 
\item{$\bullet$} Estimate a reasonable value for the capacitor's capacitance.
\item{$\bullet$} Explain the functions of the "Zero" and "Span" calibration potentiometers.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The voltage ranges for this meter are as follows:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} 0.1 volts
\item{$\bullet$} 0.2 volts
\item{$\bullet$} 1.0 volts
\item{$\bullet$} 2.0 volts
\item{$\bullet$} 10 volts
\item{$\bullet$} 20 volts
\medskip

The JFET is being used in the {\it common drain} configuration.  A reasonable value for the capacitor would be 0.01 $\mu$F.

This relatively simple DC voltage amplifier circuit provides a wealth of educational value, both for understanding the function of the JFET, and also for review on past electrical/electronics concepts.

Note: John Markus' \underbar{Guidebook of Electronic Circuits}, first edition, page 469, provided the inspiration for this circuit.
