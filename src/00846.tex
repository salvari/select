A very important parameter of operational amplifier performance is {\it slew rate}.  Describe what "slew rate" is, and why it is important for us to consider in choosing an op-amp for a particular application.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Slew rate" is the maximum rate of voltage change over time ($dv \over dt$) that an op-amp can output.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why $dv \over dt$ might be an important parameter in a circuit?  In what application(s) might we need the op-amp to "swing" its output voltage rapidly?  In what application(s) might we not care about the op-amp's slew rate?
