In this cascaded voltage divider circuit, determine the overall voltage gain ratio (from first input to last output), and also calculate the overall voltage gain in {\it decibels}, as well as the decibel figure for each divider's voltage gain:

$$\epsfbox{00829x01.eps}$$

What do you notice about the ratio figures versus the decibel figures, regarding how the individual stage gains compare with the overall gain?

Discuss with your students the nature of cascaded gain figures in both ratio and decibel formats.  Which format is easier to calculate manually (without using a calculator)?  Why is this?
