%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure that students understand the answer to this question beyond saying the phrase, "electromagnetic induction."  What, exactly, does this phrase mean?  Reciting an equation is not a sufficient explanation, either.  Ask them what some of the factors are that influence the strength of the inductive effect.
