Identify the type of logic gate shown in this schematic diagram, and explain why it has the name it does:

$$\epsfbox{02761x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02761}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an {\bf inverter} gate, so named because its output is always the opposite (inverted) state as the input.

\vskip 10pt

Note: inverter gates are often shown like this instead:

$$\epsfbox{02761x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Note: inverter gates are sometimes referred to as {\bf NOT} gates, because when the input is high, the output will {\it not} be high.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Your students should have no great difficulty identifying this particular logic gate if they have a good digital electronics reference book at their disposal.
