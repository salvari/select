Calculate the resistance value necessary for $R_2$ to make the voltmeter in this circuit register exactly zero volts:

$$\epsfbox{03396x01.eps}$$

Also, write an equation solving for $R_2$ in terms of all the other resistor values in this circuit ($R_1$, $R_3$, and $R_4$).  Hint: the battery voltage ($V_{total}$) need not appear in this equation at all!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_2$ = 3.472 k$\Omega$

$$R_2 = {{R_1 R_4} \over R_3}$$
