Explain why "switching" power supply circuits are much more common in consumer-grade electronic devices (personal computers, digital cameras and camcorders, etc.) than "brute force" power supply circuits.  Why don't manufacturers use simpler "brute force" power supplies consisting of nothing more than a transformer, rectifier, and filter?
