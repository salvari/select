What logic state does a floating CMOS gate input naturally assume?  How does this compare against traditional TTL?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A floating CMOS gate does not assume {\it any} definite logic state!  The logic state of a floating CMOS gate input is indeterminate.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what state does a floating input assume for a high-speed CMOS (74HCxx) logic gate, which is designed to be an upgrade/replacement for traditional TTL gates?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain their answer based on an analysis of the internals of a CMOS gate, versus the internals of a TTL gate.  Memorization is not good enough -- students must grasp {\it why} these different logic families behave as they do.
