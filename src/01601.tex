Determine the amount of electrical resistance indicated by an ohmmeter connected between the following points in this circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01601x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Between points A and B =
\item{$\bullet$} Between points A and C =
\item{$\bullet$} Between points C and D =
\item{$\bullet$} Between points D and B = 
\item{$\bullet$} Between points B and C = 
\medskip

Explain whether or not it makes any sense to speak of a "total" resistance for this network.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Between points A and B = 2.41 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} Between points A and C = 2.89 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} Between points C and D = 1.32 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} Between points D and B = 2.10 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} Between points B and C = 2.75 k$\Omega$
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to realize that the resistance "looking into" different areas of a resistive network depends on what those areas are.
