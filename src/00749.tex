Explain how the following bias networks function:

$$\epsfbox{00749x01.eps}$$

Each one has the same basic purpose, but works in a different way to accomplish it.  Describe the purpose of any biasing network in an AC signal amplifier, and comment on the different means of accomplishing this purpose employed by each of the three circuits.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The purpose of any biasing network in an AC signal amplifier is to provide just enough quiescent current through the base to keep the transistor between the extremes of cutoff and saturation throughout the input signal's waveform cycle.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

All three biasing techniques are commonly used in transistor amplifier circuitry, so it behooves each student to understand them well.  In each case, resistors provide a "trickle" of current through the base of the transistor to keep it turned partially "on" at all times.
