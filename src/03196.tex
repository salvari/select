It is important to not make resistor $R_1$ too small in value.  Explain why, and what might happen if it were.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In the 555's discharge cycle, resistor $R_1$ will drop (almost) the full power supply voltage when $R_{pot1}$ is set for minimum resistance.  Not only could this overheat $R_1$, but it could also damage the discharge transistor within the 555 timer.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order to really understand {\it why} insufficient resistance at $R_1$ would be a bad thing, students must understand the astable operating cycle of the 555 timer.  This question provides a very practical context in which to explore and/or review it!
