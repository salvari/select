Calculate one possible set of resistor values that would produce the following percentage splits in current:

$$\epsfbox{00366x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00366}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There are many different sets of resistor values that will achieve this design goal!  I'll let you try to determine one of your own.
