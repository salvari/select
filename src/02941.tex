Calculate the amount of time it takes for a 10 $\mu$F capacitor to discharge from 18 volts to 7 volts if its ultimate (final) voltage when fully discharged will be 0 volts, and it is discharging through a 22 k$\Omega$ resistor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order for students to solve this problem, they must algebraically manipulate the "normal" time-constant formula to solve for time instead of solving for voltage.
