$$\epsfbox{02004x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02004x02.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02004x04.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02004x05.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02004x06.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note how much the Fermi level is affected by the addition of dopants to an otherwise pure semiconducting material.  Understanding this effect is critical to the understanding of PN semiconductor junctions.
