%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I have seen more than one method for determining the "common-ness" of an amplifier configuration, and not all are satisfying.  Rather than telling your students how to distinguish one amplifier type from the others, let them examine the different configurations in the answer and figure out their own method(s)!
