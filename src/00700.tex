Compare the voltage gains of these two opamp circuits:

$$\epsfbox{00700x01.eps}$$

Which one has the greater $A_V$, and why?

\underbar{file 00700}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{00700x02.eps}$$

This opamp circuit has the greater voltage gain, because its $Z_{feedback} \over Z_{input}$ ratio is greater.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is common to see impedances represented as boxes, if their constituent components are not germane to the operation of the circuit.
