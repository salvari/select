Calculate the total impedance of this series RLC circuit and express it in polar form (magnitude and phase angle):

$$\epsfbox{03626x01.eps}$$

${\bf Z_{total}}$ = 

\underbar{file 03626}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

${\bf Z_{total}}$ = 2.242 k$\Omega$ $\angle$ -11.13$^{o}$

\vskip 10pt

I recommend assigning 4 points to the correct magnitude and 4 points to the correct angle.
