Describe the operating principles of these three methods for starting single-phase induction motors:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Shaded pole
\item{$\bullet$} Split-phase, capacitor
\item{$\bullet$} Split-phase (resistor or inductor)
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In each of these techniques, a "trick" is used to create a truly rotating magnetic field from what would normally be a reciprocating (single-phase) magnetic field.  The "shaded pole" technique is magnetic, while the other two techniques use phase-shifting.  I will leave research of the details up to you.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are many details which can be discussed with students regarding these methods of single-phase motor starting.  Thankfully, there are many good-quality sources of information on single-phase motor theory and construction, so finding information on this topic will not be difficult for your students.
