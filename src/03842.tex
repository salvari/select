Identify which transistor terminal functions as the {\it source} and which transistor terminal functions as the {\it drain} in both of these JFET circuits:

$$\epsfbox{03842x01.eps}$$

Most importantly, explain {\it why} we define the terminals as such, given the fact that is usually no physical difference between these two terminals of a JFET.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{03842x02.eps}$$

The "why" answer is related to the type of majority charge carrier within the channel of each JFET.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The distinction between source and drain for any kind of FET (JFET or MOSFET) is important because the controlling voltage ($V_{GS}$) must be applied between gate and {\it source}, not between gate and {\it drain}.
