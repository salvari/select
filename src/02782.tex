Convert the following logic gate circuit into a Boolean expression, writing Boolean sub-expressions next to each gate output in the diagram:

$$\epsfbox{02782x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02782}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02782x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The process of converting gate circuits into Boolean expressions is really quite simple, if you proceed gate by gate.  Have your students share whatever methods or "tricks" they use to write the expressions with the rest of the class.
