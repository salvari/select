Plot the typical response of a band-stop filter circuit, showing signal output (amplitude) on the vertical axis and frequency on the horizontal axis:

$$\epsfbox{01951x01.eps}$$

Also, identify and label the {\it bandwidth} of the circuit on your filter plot.

\underbar{file 01951}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01951x02.eps}$$

The bandwidth of a band-stop filter circuit is that range of frequencies where the output amplitude is reduced to at least 70.7\% of full attenuation:

$$\epsfbox{01951x03.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Bandwidth is an important concept in electronics, for more than just filter circuits.  Your students may discover references to bandwidth of amplifiers, transmission lines, and other circuit elements as they do their research.  Despite the many and varied applications of this term, the principle is fundamentally the same.
