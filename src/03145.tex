A popular strategy for AC induction motor control is the use of {\it variable frequency drive} units, or VFDs.  Explain what varying the frequency of power to an AC induction motor accomplishes, and why this might be advantageous.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Variable frequency drives allow for the precise and efficient control of induction motor speed, which is not possible by other means.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Central to the answer of this question is the principle of a {\it rotating magnetic field} and how rotor speed is primarily a function of line frequency.  While the internal details of a VFD are quite complex, the basic operating principle (and rationale) is not.
