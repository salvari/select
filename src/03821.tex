The following animation shows a bridge rectifier circuit in action.  Here are some things to look for:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note that the diodes' forward voltage drops create "dead zones" in the output waveform.  This is one of the reasons that calculation of a rectifier circuit's effective DC output voltage is complicated: it is not a straightforward task to predict how wide these dead zones are, and to quantify the effect they have on the output voltage.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this animation is to let students study the behavior of this amplifier circuit and reach their own conclusions.  Similar to experimentation in the lab, except that here all the data collection is done visually rather than through the use of test equipment, and the students are able to "see" things that are invisible in real life.
