What does it mean if a battery, or a bank of batteries, receives a {\it floating} charge?  What does it mean if a battery, or a bank of batteries, receives an {\it equalizing} charge?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "floating" charge is a very low charge rate, just enough to maintain a state of full charge despite normal load fluctuations on the power bus.  An "equalizing" charge is a state of overcharging, done to equalize the chemistry in all cells of a battery.

Follow-up question: qualitatively speaking, at what voltage should the power supply be set to in order to "float" a battery bank, versus in order to "equalize" a battery bank?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Being able to identify these types of charge strategies is important, because many battery-powered systems with automatic chargers are either designed to charge in a particular way, or have the ability to switch between different charging modes.  Failure to properly charge a battery, or a battery bank, will lead to decreased performance and/or decreased life.
