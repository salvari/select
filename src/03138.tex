Suppose an engineer draws the following timing diagram for a time-delay relay circuit and then hands the diagram to a technician to figure out how to build it:

$$\epsfbox{03138x01.eps}$$

The technician, being well educated in the ways of time-delay relays, takes one look at this timing diagram and begins to laugh.  Explain why this diagram is funny.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Time-delay relays can do a lot of neat things, but they cannot predict the future!

%(END_ANSWER)

The real purpose of this question is to get students to recognize an impossibility in timing diagrams.  As an instructor, I see students mistakes such as this once in a while.  Those students who have trouble answering this question may not yet fully understand how to interpret timing diagrams!
