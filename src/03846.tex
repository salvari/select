In this circuit, a comparator is set up to detect whether the outside or inside temperature is greater, and turns on a cooling fan when conditions are right.  Predict how the operation of this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Comparator $U_1$ output fails low: {\it Fan never turns on.}
\item{$\bullet$} NAND gate $U_2$ output fails low: {\it Fan always remains on.}
\item{$\bullet$} NAND gate $U_2$ output fails high: {\it Fan never turns on.}
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails shorted (drain to source): {\it Fan always remains on.}
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it Fan never turns on.}
\item{$\bullet$} Thermistor $R_3$ fails open: {\it Fan never turns on.}
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_4$ fails open: {\it Fan always remains on.}
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across thermistor $R_1$: {\it Fan never turns on.}

Follow-up question: does $Q_1$ source or sink current?  What about $Q_2$?
