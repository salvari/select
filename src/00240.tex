Suppose this circuit has a problem: the light bulb does not light up when the switch is turned "ON".  You suspect that a "bad" connection may exist in the circuit which is preventing current.  How would you test the integrity of each connection using a voltmeter only?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If voltage is measured across any connection of two wires, that connection is definitely faulty.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It may be more difficult that it first appears to test for voltage across any single connection, if the wires are covered with insulation!  Ask your students this question: if you test for voltage between two screws on a terminal strip, how many electrical connections are you actually measuring voltage across?
