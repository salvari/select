Resonant electric circuits are analogous to resonant mechanical systems.  They both oscillate, and their oscillation is founded on an exchange of energy between two different forms.

Mechanical engineers studying vibrations in machinery sometimes use capacitors and inductors to model the physical characteristics of mechanical systems.  Specifically, capacitors model {\it elasticity}, while inductors model {\it mass}.

Explain what mechanical quantities in a resonant system are analogous to voltage and current in a resonant circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Mechanical force and velocity are analogous to electrical voltage and current, respectively.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: specifically relate voltage and current for an inductor to force and velocity for a mass, and voltage and current for a capacitor to force and velocity for a spring.  Illustrate the similarities mathematically, where possible!

This is a challenging question, and it is one I would reserve for students destined to become engineers.  However, once answered, it brings deep insight to the phenomenon of resonance both mechanical and electrical.
