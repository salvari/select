%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A {\it spectrum analyzer}.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge questions: two similar instruments are the {\it wave analyzer} and the {\it Fourier analyzer}.  Explain how both these instruments are similar in function to a spectrum analyzer, and also how both differ.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Spectrum analyzers capable of analyzing radio-frequency signals are very expensive, but low-cost personal computer hardware and software does a good job of analyzing complex audio signals.  It would be a benefit to your class to have a low-frequency spectrum analyzer setup available for student use, and possible demonstration during discussion.
