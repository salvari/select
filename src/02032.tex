If we were to compare the energy diagrams for three pieces of semiconducting material, two "N" type and one "P" type, side-by-side, we would see something like this:

$$\epsfbox{02032x01.eps}$$

The presence of dopants in the semiconducting materials creates differences in the Fermi energy level ($E_f$) within each piece.

Draw a new energy diagram showing the equilibrium state of the three pieces after being joined together.

If students are familiar with energy band diagrams for PN diode junctions, they should have no great difficulty drawing an energy diagram for an NPN junction.
