Identify which trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, or tangent) are represented by each of the following ratios, with reference to the angle labeled with the Greek letter "Theta" ($\Theta$):

$${X \over R} = $$

$${X \over Z} = $$

$${R \over Z} = $$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02084x01.eps}$$

$${X \over R} = \tan \Theta = {\hbox{Opposite} \over \hbox{Adjacent}}$$

$${X \over Z} = \sin \Theta = {\hbox{Opposite} \over \hbox{Hypotenuse}}$$

$${R \over Z} = \cos \Theta = {\hbox{Adjacent} \over \hbox{Hypotenuse}}$$

Ask your students to explain what the words "hypotenuse", "opposite", and "adjacent" refer to in a right triangle.
