"FM" means "frequency modulation," and it refers to the encoding of a waveform by changing (modulating) the frequency of another.  This is the technology used in broadcast FM radio transmission:

$$\epsfbox{01145x01.eps}$$

This is how FM radio communication works: by modulating the frequency of a radio-frequency (RF) signal according to the amplitude of the voltage signal produced by a microphone.

Explain how a phase-locked loop circuit could be used to {\it "demodulate"} the output of an FM radio station, so as to extract the broadcaster's audio signal from the RF waveform.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This diagram, of course, shows a much-simplified system for FM demodulation:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Despite the crudeness of the answer given, the basic operational theory of a PLL demodulator should be apparent for students to see.  Discuss the operation of this circuit with your students, making sure all of them comprehend the purpose of a PLL.
