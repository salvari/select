Identify at least two faults in this simple logic gate circuit that could cause its output to fail in the "low" logic state:

$$\epsfbox{03830x01.eps}$$

Be sure to explain {\it why} the proposed faults would cause the output to fail low.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ failed shorted (collector to emitter)
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_2$ failed shorted (collector to emitter)
\item{$\bullet$} Input line A shorted to ground
\item{$\bullet$} Input line B shorted to ground
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_{pullup}$ failed open
\medskip

Follow-up question: though all of these faults {\it would} cause the output to go low, not all of them would cause the output to go low in the same way.  Explain this.
