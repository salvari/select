Identify the type of oscillator circuit shown in this schematic diagram, and explain the purpose of the tank circuit ($L_1$ and $C_1$):

$$\epsfbox{02632x01.eps}$$

Also, write the equation describing the operating frequency of this type of oscillator circuit.

\underbar{file 02632}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it Meissner} oscillator circuit, and the tank circuit establishes its frequency of operation.

$$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_1}}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to describe the amount of phase shift the tank circuit provides to the feedback signal.  Also, ask them to explain how the oscillator circuit's natural frequency may be altered.

This circuit is unusual, as inductors $L_2$ and $L_3$ are not coupled to each other, but each is coupled to tank circuit inductor $L_1$.
