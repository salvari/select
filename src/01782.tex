Explain what will happen to the first load's voltage and current in this voltage divider circuit if the second load develops a short-circuit fault:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Ideally, the first load's voltage and current will remain unaffected by any fault within load \#2.  However, in the event of a short-circuit in load \#2, the source voltage will almost surely decrease due to its own internal resistance.  In fact, it would not be surprising if the circuit voltage decreased almost to zero volts, if it is a "hard" short in load \#2!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

While it is important for students to realize that the second load constitutes a separate parallel branch in the circuit and therefore (ideally) has no effect on the rest of the circuit, it is crucial for them to understand that such an ideal condition is rare in the real world.  When "hard" short-circuits are involved, even small internal source resistances become extremely significant.
