Electrical inductance has a close mechanical analogy: {\it inertia}.  Explain what mechanical "inertia" is, and how the quantities of velocity and force applied to an object with mass are respectively analogous to current and voltage applied to an inductance.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

As an object is subjected to a constant, unbalanced force, its velocity changes at a linear rate:

$$F = m{dv \over dt}$$

\noindent
Where,

$F = $ Net force applied to object

$m = $ Mass of object

$v = $ Velocity of object

$t = $ Time

In a similar manner, a pure inductance experiencing a constant voltage will exhibit a constant rate of current change over time:

$$e = L{di \over dt}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Explain to your students how the similarities between inertia and inductance are so close, that inductors can be used to electrically model mechanical inertia.
