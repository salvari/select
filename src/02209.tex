Explain how the construction of an {\it isolation} transformer differs from that of a {\it step-up} or {\it step-down} transformer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Step-down transformers have fewer secondary turns than primary turns, while step-up transformers have more secondary turns than primary turns.  Isolation transformers have equal turns in both windings.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain the relationship between primary and secondary turns, and how this affects the voltage transformation ratio, based on mutual inductance.
