Suppose this battery and light bulb circuit failed to work:

$$\epsfbox{00122x01.eps}$$

Using a voltmeter, a technician measures full battery voltage between the points C and H.  What does this single measurement indicate about the condition of the circuit?  Be as specific as you can.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Based on this one measurement, we are able to determine that the battery is outputting full voltage, and that the circuit wiring is continuous from the negative battery terminal to point C, and from the positive battery terminal to point H.  The fault is an "open" somewhere to the right of points C and H -- possibly more than one.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some measurements given definite answers, while others only indefinite answers.  In this particular question, the single voltage measurement tells us definite things about the left-hand side of the circuit, but little about the right-hand side.  It is very important for students to develop the logical skill of distinguishing {\it necessary} conclusions from {\it possible} conclusions in troubleshooting scenarios.  A skill like this takes time and practice to develop, so be sure to spend adequate time throughout the course with your students honing it!
