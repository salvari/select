Add an op-amp circuit to the output of this passive averager network to produce a {\it summer} circuit: an operational circuit generating an output voltage equal to the {\it sum} of the four input voltages.  Then, write an equation describing the whole circuit's function.

$$V_{sum} = V_a + V_b + V_c + V_d$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The equation for this circuit is simple enough as to require no explanation.  How your students derived this equation, from the base equation of a passive averager network, on the other hand, is worth discussion.  Discuss with them the necessary gain of the op-amp circuit, and how this gain figure converts an averaging function into a summing function.
