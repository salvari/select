High-power circuits containing SCRs and TRIACs often contain {\it snubber} networks comprised of resistors and capacitors connected close to the thyristor devices to shield them from transient voltage "spikes."  Explain why it is important to guard a thyristor device from seeing a fast-rising voltage, even if that voltage is not large enough to directly cause any damage to the thyristor or other components.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A fast rate of voltage rise over time (${dv \over dt}$) is capable of prematurely triggering the thyristor, which could consequently damage the circuit or just cause imprecise control.
