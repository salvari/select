Which way would you have to move the potentiometer wiper, to the left or to the right, in order to increase current through resistor R1?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

You would have to move the potentiometer wiper to the {\it left}.

Follow-up question: what would happen to the current through resistor R2 as you moved the wiper in that direction (closer to resistor R1)?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This circuit is fairly self-explanatory.
