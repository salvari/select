Shown here are two different voltage amplifier circuits with the same voltage gain.  Which of them has greater input impedance, and why?  Try to give as specific an answer for each circuit's input impedance as possible.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The noninverting amplifier circuit has extremely high input impedance (most likely many millions of ohms), while the inverting amplifier circuit only has 5 k$\Omega$ of input impedance.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If students have difficulty grasping the concept of input impedance, and how to figure that out for circuits such as these, remind them that input impedance is fundamentally defined by the following equation:

$$Z_{in} = {V_{in} \over I_{in}}$$

With this in mind, encourage them to set up a "thought experiment" by where they assume a given input voltage and analyze the circuit step-by-step using Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, and the basic rules of closed-loop, negative feedback opamp behavior.  The results of the "thought experiment" should conclusively demonstrate which circuit has the greater input impedance.
