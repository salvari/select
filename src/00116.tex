Approximately 11 milliseconds (0.0107 seconds).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Electricity is fast: the effects of electron motion travel at approximately the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).  Actual average electron velocity, on the other hand, is very, very slow.  A convenient analogy I've used to illustrate how electrons may move slowly yet have rapid effect is that of a closed-loop hydraulic system.  When the valve is opened, fluid motion throughout the system is immediate (actually, the motion progresses at the speed of sound through the fluid -- very fast!), yet the actual velocity of fluid motion is much slower.

Incidentally, the double-chevron symbols indicate an electrical connector pair (plug and jack; male and female).
