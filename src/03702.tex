Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03702x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Load resistor fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open: {\it Load resistor receives half-wave rectified power instead of full-wave, more voltage across $D_1$}.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails open: {\it Load resistor receives half-wave rectified power instead of full-wave, more voltage across $D_2$}.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Load resistor fails open: {\it No current on secondary side of circuit, little current in primary side of circuit, no voltage drop across either $D_1$ or $D_2$}.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open: {\it No current or voltage anywhere on secondary side of circuit, no current in primary side of circuit}.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
