%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$a = cd^2 + b \hbox{\hskip 140pt} a = \sqrt{{c \over d} - b}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for $a$ in each equation.  Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.
