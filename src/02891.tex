One way to think of the basic logic gate types (all but the XOR and XNOR gates) is to consider what single input state guarantees a certain output state.  For example, we could describe the function of an OR gate as such:

$$\hbox{\it Any high input guarantees a high output.}$$

Identify what type of gate is represented by each of the following phrases:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Any high input guarantees a low output.
\item{$\bullet$} Any low input guarantees a high output.
\item{$\bullet$} Any low input guarantees a low output.
\medskip

\underbar{file 02891}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Any high input guarantees a low output: {\bf NOR} gate.
\item{$\bullet$} Any low input guarantees a high output: {\bf NAND} gate.
\item{$\bullet$} Any low input guarantees a low output: {\bf AND} gate.
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very useful way to think of the different logic gate types, as often you are faced with a choice of which gate type to use for a specific function in a digital circuit based on a requirement cast in these terms ("Any {\it blank} input guarantees a {\it blank} output").

For example, we might need a gate to perform a "disable" function for a digital signal:

$$\epsfbox{02891x01.eps}$$

Considered in terms of what input state forces a low output, the choice to use an AND gate becomes obvious.
