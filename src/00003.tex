Suppose you are building a cabin far away from electric power service, but you desire to have electricity available to energize light bulbs, a radio, a computer, and other useful devices.  Determine at least three different ways you could generate electrical power to supply the electric power needs at this cabin.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There are several different devices capable of producing electrical power for this cabin of yours:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Engine-driven generator
\item{$\bullet$} Solar cell
\item{$\bullet$} Thermopile
\item{$\bullet$} Windmill
\medskip

For each of these devices, what is its operating principle, and where does it obtain its energy from?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

For each of these electric power "sources," there is a more fundamental source of energy.  People often mistakenly think of generator devices as magic sources of energy, where they are really nothing more than energy {\it converters}: transforming energy from one form to another.
