An easy way to increase the effective current gain of a transistor is to "cascade" two of them in a configuration called a {\it Darlington pair}:

Complete this schematic diagram, showing how a Darlington pair could be used to enable a cadmium sulfide (CdS) photocell to turn a motor on and off:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to define "gain" as it applies to a transistor circuit.  Ask them to explain why a Darlington pair has a greater current gain than a single transistor, and why that trait is important in a circuit such as this.
