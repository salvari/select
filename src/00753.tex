Stereo (two-speaker) headphones typically use a plug with three contact points to connect the speakers to the audio amplifier.  The three contact points are designated as "tip," "ring," and "sleeve" for reasons that are obvious upon inspection, and as such the plug is commonly referred to as a "TRS" plug.  Both speakers in the headphone unit share a common connection (at the "sleeve" contact), with the "tip" and "ring" contacts providing connection to left and right speakers, respectively:

Draw a picture showing how connections would be made to the plug's contact points to form this circuit:

This question challenges students to determine what "common" means, in relation to the speaker connections.  Also, it requires that they translate the nice, clean schematic diagram into a real-world illustration, which is a difficult task for some (but well worth the time to practice!).
