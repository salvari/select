In order to successfully answer this question, students will have to identify what the "bubble" means on the clock input, and relate that to the timing diagram.  Ask your students to share any tips they may have regarding the analysis of timing diagrams, specifically what points in the diagram are critical (i.e. what points in time are the only points where the outputs may actually change states).
