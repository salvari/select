Suppose you were given a component and told it was either a resistor, an inductor, or a capacitor.  The component is unmarked, and impossible to visually identify.  Explain what steps you would take to electrically identify what type of component it was, and what its value was, without the use of any test equipment except a signal generator, a multimeter (capable of measuring nothing but voltage, current, and resistance), and some miscellaneous passive components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches, etc.).  Demonstrate your technique if possible.

Did you really think I would give you the answer to this?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is an excellent opportunity to brainstorm as a group and experiment on real components.  There is obviously more than one way to make the determinations of identity and value!  Use the class time to engage your students in lively discussion and debate over how to approach this practical problem.
