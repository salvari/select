What do the symbols with the question marks next to them refer to?  In the circuit shown, would the light bulb be energized?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

These are {\it ground} symbols, and they can either refer to connections made to a common conductor (such as the metal chassis of an automobile or circuit enclosure), or the actual earth (usually via metal rods driven into the dirt).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask the students about the relative conductivities of metal chassis versus dirt (earth ground).  Is a current pathway formed by two metal chassis grounds equivalent to a current pathway formed by two earth grounds?  Why or why not?  What conditions may affect these relative conductivities?
