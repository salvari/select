If a wire coil with 450 turns is exposed to a magnetic flux increasing at a rate of 0.008 Webers per second, how much voltage will be induced across the coil?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

3.6 volts

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is simply a quantitative application of Faraday's Law.  There is no significance to the fact that the magnetic flux is increasing rather than decreasing.  The only effect this would have on the induced voltage is its polarity.
