Match each written function ($y = \cdots$) with the sketched graph it fits best:

$$y = 3x + 2 \hbox{\hskip 70pt} y = 5 - 2x$$

$$y = x^2 \hbox{\hskip 70pt} y = 2^x$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The primary purpose of this question is to have students figure out {\it how} to match each expression to a graph.  Of course, one could take the time to plot each function one by one, but there exist much simpler ways to determine the "character" of a function without plotting the whole thing.
