One method of driving pixels in a grid-based display is to organize the pixels into rows and columns, then select individual pixels for illumination by the intersection of a specific row line and a specific column line.  In this example, we are controlling an 8 $\times$ 8 grid of LEDs with two 8-bit (1-byte) ports of a microcontroller:

$$\epsfbox{04053x01.eps}$$

Note that a {\it high} state is required on one of port B's pins to activate a row, and a {\it low} state is required on one of port A's pins to activate a column, because the LED anodes connect to port A and the LED cathodes connect to port B.

\vskip 10pt

Determine the hexadecimal codes we would need to output at ports A and B to energize the LED in the far lower-left corner of the 8 $\times$ 8 grid.

Port A =
