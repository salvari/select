Choose appropriate values for this Sallen-Key high-pass filter circuit to give it a cutoff frequency of 7 kHz with a "Butterworth" response:

$$\epsfbox{02575x01.eps}$$

$$f_{-3dB} = {\sqrt{2} \over {2 \pi R C}}$$

A good guideline to follow is to make sure no component impedance ($Z_R$ or $Z_C$) at the cutoff frequency is less than 1 k$\Omega$ or greater than 100 k$\Omega$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Bear in mind that this is just one possible set of component values:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $C$ = 3.3 nF
\item{$\bullet$} $R$ = 9.744 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} ${R \over 2}$ = 4.872 k$\Omega$
\medskip

Follow-up question: how would you suggest we obtain the precise resistance values necessary to build this circuit?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order for students to solve for $R$, they must algebraically manipulate the cutoff frequency formula.  Ask them why we might choose a standard value for capacitance and then calculate a non-standard value for resistance.  Why not the other way around (first choose $R$, then calculate $C$)?
