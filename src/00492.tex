Calculate the total voltage of these series-connected voltage sources:

\underbar{file 00492}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a "trick" question, because only the total voltage of the DC sources may be predicted with certainty.  There is insufficient information to calculate the total AC voltage for the two series-connected AC sources!

$$\epsfbox{00492x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students exactly why the total voltage of the two series-connected AC sources cannot be determined, given the little information we have about them.  Is it possible for their total voltage to be 8 VAC, just like the series-aiding DC sources?  Is it possible for their total voltage to be 2 VAC, just like the series-opposing DC sources?  Why or why not?
