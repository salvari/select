A piece of laboratory equipment uses a voltage divider to reduce voltage to two electromagnet coils from a higher-voltage source.  Coil \#1 is supposed to receive 2.91 volts and coil \#2 is supposed to receive 13.11 volts:

$$\epsfbox{03487x01.eps}$$

One day, something goes wrong with this circuit.  The magnetic field from coil \#1 suddenly disappears, yet there is still a magnetic field coming from coil \#2.  The technician who looked at this problem before you took two voltage measurements and then gave up: 13.55 volts at test point TP3 and 5.42 volts at test point TP4.  You left your multimeter back at the shop, which means you cannot take any more voltage measurements.  However, since you are more determined than the former technician, you proceed to identify the following from the two measurements already taken:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} \underbar{Two} components or wires in the circuit that you know cannot be failed either open or shorted, besides the 24 volt source which is obviously operational.
\vskip 40pt
\item{$\bullet$} \underbar{One} component or wire in the circuit you think could possibly be bad, and the type of failure it would be (either open or shorted).

{\bf Components which could possibly be faulted:}

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Wire from TP4 to TP5 broken (open)
\item{$\bullet$} Coil \#1 failed open
