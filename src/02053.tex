The dark shaded area drawn in this cross-section of a PN junction represents the {\it depletion region}:

$$\epsfbox{02053x01.eps}$$

Re-draw the depletion region when the PN junction is subjected to a reverse-bias voltage:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02053x03.eps}$$

Follow-up questions: describe the conductivity of the depletion region: is it high or low?  What exactly does the word "depletion" refer to, anyway?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question makes a good lead-in to a discussion of JFET operation, where the channel conductivity is modulated by the width of the gate-channel depletion region.
