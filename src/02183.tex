An oscilloscope is connected to a low-current AC motor circuit to measure both voltage and current, and plot them against one another as a Lissajous figure:

$$\epsfbox{02183x01.eps}$$

The following Lissajous figure is obtained from this measurement:

$$\epsfbox{02183x02.eps}$$

From this figure, calculate the phase angle ($\Theta$) and the power factor for this motor circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$\Theta$ $\approx$ 57$^{o}$ \hskip 20pt P.F. $\approx$ 0.54

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: is this the only way we could have used the oscilloscope to measure phase shift between voltage and current, or is there another mode of operation besides plotting Lissajous figures?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain the function of the resistor $R_{shunt}$ shown in the schematic diagram.  Discuss whether or not this resistor should have a very low or a very high resistance value.  Also discuss the placement of the oscilloscope's ground clip, which is very important in a potentially lethal AC power circuit.
