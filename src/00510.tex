Write an equation solving for the temperature of a conductor ($T$), given its resistance at that temperature ($R_T$), its resistance at a standard reference temperature ($R_r$ @ $T_r$), and its temperature coefficient of resistance at that same reference temperature ($\alpha$ @ $T_r$).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$T = {{{R_T \over R_r} - 1} \over \alpha} + T_r$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students may be able to find this equation in a textbook somewhere, but the point of this question is really to have them perform algebraic manipulation to derive this equation from another.
