If the power waveform is plotted for a resistive AC circuit, it will look like this:

$$\epsfbox{02174x01.eps}$$

What is the significance of the power value always being {\it positive} (above the zero line) and never negative (below the zero line)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Positive power represents energy flowing from the source to the (resistive) load, in this case meaning that energy never returns from the load back to the source.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what it means in physical terms for energy to flow to a resistive load, and what it would mean for energy to flow from a resistive load back to the source.

%INDEX% Power, instantaneous, in AC circuit with no phase shift between V and I
