Determine the voltage dropped between points {\bf A} and {\bf B} in this circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02115x01.eps}$$

Hint: convert the parallel RC sub-network into a series equivalent first.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{AB}$ = 10.491 volts

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although there are other ways to calculate this voltage drop, it is good for students to learn the method of series-parallel subcircuit equivalents.  If for no other reason, this method has the benefit of requiring less tricky math (no complex numbers needed!).

Have your students explain the procedures they used to find the answer, so that all may benefit from seeing multiple methods of solution and multiple ways of explaining it.
