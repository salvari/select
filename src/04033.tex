Determine all component voltage drops in this circuit when the motor is operating in the reverse direction.  Be sure to explain how you performed all the analyses!  Assume 0.7 volts as the standard forward voltage drop for a forward-biased PN junction, and 0.3 volts as the standard collector-to-emitter voltage drop for a saturated BJT.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll give you a hint: use {\it Kirchhoff's Voltage Law}.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what type of DC motor must this be, to be reversed in rotational direction by a reversal of polarity?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The primary purpose of this question is to give students more practice using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.  Be sure to work through the analysis of {\it all} component voltage drops.
