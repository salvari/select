With regard to a DC electric generator, what is the {\it neutral plane}?  Why is this important?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The "neutral plane" is that point of rotation where a rotating armature winding has no induced voltage in it, due to $d\phi \over dt$ being equal to zero.  In a simple, two-pole machine, the neutral plane is perpendicular to the centerline of the field poles:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why the "neutral plane" is an important aspect of a DC generator or motor's geometry.  What relation does the neutral plane have with regard to brush positioning?  At what point in the armature's rotation do we want to have the brushes break contact with one commutator bar and make contact with another: when the coil primary to that commutator segment is outputting maximum voltage, or minimum voltage?
