%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students must have a firm understanding of what constitutes "series" versus "parallel" in real circuits.  Here is a place where some students will feel uncomfortable because the textbook definitions they memorized are easier said than applied.  It is imperative that students have a strong working knowledge of terms, and do not simply memorize definitions.

%INDEX% Series, defined
%INDEX% Series versus parallel
%INDEX% Parallel, defined
%INDEX% Parallel versus series
