%(BEGIN_NOTES)

While it is easy enough for students to look up definitions for these words from any number of references, it is important that they be able to cast them into their own words.  Remembering a definition is not the same as really understanding it, and if a student is unable to describe the meaning of a term using their own words then they definitely do not understand it!  It is also helpful to encourage students to give real-life examples of these terms.
