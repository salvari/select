A potential cause of arc flash, and perhaps even arc blast, is {\it improper} meter use.  Describe how an ammeter could be mis-applied to a live circuit in such a way that it causes an arc flash or arc blast.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Never, never connect an ammeter across two points in a circuit with substantial voltage between them!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why an ammeter should never be connected across a voltage source, {\it especially} a voltage source in an electrical power system.  Relate this to the ideal input resistance of ammeters, and to Ohm's Law.
