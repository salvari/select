The mathematical inverse, or reciprocal, of resistance ($R$) is a quantity called {\it conductance} ($G$).

$$G = {1 \over R}$$

Is there an equivalent quantity for impedance ($Z$)?  What is the reciprocal of impedance, and what unit of measurement is it expressed in?  Hint: its symbol is $Y$.

Is there an equivalent quantity for reactance ($X$)?  What is the reciprocal of reactance, and what unit of measurement is it expressed in?  Hint: its symbol is $B$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Y =$ {\it admittance}, which is the reciprocal of impedance.

$$Y = {1 \over Z}$$

Admittance is expressed in the unit of {\it siemens}.

\vskip 10pt

$B =$ {\it susceptance}, which is the reciprocal of reactance.

$$B = {1 \over X}$$

Susceptance is also expressed in the unit of {\it siemens}.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students where they obtained this information.  Also ask them what the old (pre-siemens) unit of measurement was.

Where would such quantities be useful in AC circuit calculations?  Ask your students where the quantity of conductance ($G$) is useful in DC circuit calculations.
