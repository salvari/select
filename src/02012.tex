%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I've used 0.47 $\mu$F capacitors and 1N4001 diodes with good success on a 10 volt AC (RMS) power supply.  I recommend using low-capacity capacitors to minimize the amount of stored energy, since voltages in this circuit are potentially hazardous.
