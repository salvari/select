Explain the difference between {\it static} RAM ("SRAM") and {\it dynamic} RAM ("DRAM") memory technologies.  Which type of memory technology provides faster access of data, and why?  Which type of memory technology provides the greatest storage density, and why?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Static RAM provides the fastest access, while dynamic RAM provides the greatest amount of memory per physical volume (storage density).

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: how is {\it refreshing} provided for dynamic RAM chips?  Is this something taken care of internal to the chip, or must the circuit designer provide external circuitry to refresh the dynamic RAM chip's memory cells?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students where they obtained their information on static versus dynamic RAM technologies.  Extra credit for consulting datasheets!
