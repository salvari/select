Shown here is the schematic symbol for a {\it resistor}:

$$\epsfbox{00059x01.eps}$$

What is the purpose of a resistor?  What function does it perform?  Also, draw an illustration of what a real resistor looks like.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The purpose of a {\it resistor} is to provide a precise amount of electrical resistance in a circuit.  Here is an illustration of a small (1/8 or 1/4 watt) resistor:

$$\epsfbox{00059x02.eps}$$

It is also good to know that the zig-zag symbol shown in the question is not the only symbol used to represent resistors.  Another common resistor symbol is shown here:

$$\epsfbox{00059x03.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students may (properly) ask, "Why is there such a thing as a component whose sole purpose is to {\it impede} the flow of electrons?"  While resistors may seem rather pointless at first, they end up being extremely valuable electrical/electronic components.  If asked, you may cite several uses of resistors in circuits:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} To limit maximum circuit current to a safe value.
\item{$\bullet$} To "split" a voltage into proportions.
\item{$\bullet$} To "scale" meter movements, for precise measurement of current and voltage.
\item{$\bullet$} To provide a non-shorting path to discharge static electricity.
