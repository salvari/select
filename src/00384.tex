If the ends of a wire loop are attached to two half-circular metal strips, arranged so that the two strips almost form a complete circle, and those strips are contacted by two "brushes" which connect to opposite poles of a battery, which way will the wire loop rotate?

Clockwise, continuously.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students with this question: is there any way we can get the wire loop to continuously rotate without using those half-circle metal strips to make and break contact with the battery?  Ask your students what the two half-circle metal strips are called, in electric motor/generator terminology.

%INDEX% Commutator, DC electric motor
