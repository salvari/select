The following RC circuit constitutes an {\it automatic reset} network for the counter.  At power-up, it resets the counter to {\tt 0000}, then allows it to count normally:

$$\epsfbox{03902x01.eps}$$

Predict how the operation of this automatic reset circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it Counter may not reset at power-up.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it Counter will not count, output stuck at {\tt 0000}.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open: {\it Counter will not count, output stuck at {\tt 0000}.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted: {\it Counter will not count, output stuck at {\tt 0000}.}
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: suggest some reasonable values for the three resistors and the capacitor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
