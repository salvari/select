A technician wants to energize a 24 volt motor, but lacks a 24 volt battery to do it with.  Instead, she has access to several "power supply" units which convert 120 volt AC power from a power receptacle into low-voltage DC power that is adjustable over a range of 0 to 15 volts.  Each of these power supplies is a box with a power cord, voltage adjustment knob, and two output terminals for connection with the DC voltage it produces:

Draw a picture of how this technician might use power supplies to energize the 24 volt motor.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is perhaps the most direct solution (setting each power supply to output 12 volts):

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although this is a very simple and direct solution, it is not the only possible one.  Incidentally, this scenario is very common in electronics work: having to couple multiple power supplies together to achieve a desired total voltage or total current.
