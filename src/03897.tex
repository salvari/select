Identify a single fault that would allow this synchronous counter circuit to count up on demand, but not down:

$$\epsfbox{03897x01.eps}$$

Explain {\it why} your proposed fault would cause the problem.

\underbar{file 03897}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Two possibilities are immediately apparent: inverter $U_5$ has a failed-low output, or flip-flop $U_1$ has a failed-low $\overline{Q}$ output.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss the merit of all faults proposed in answer to this question with your students.  Ask them to explain the reasoning behind their answers, and use this as an opportunity to correct conceptual errors about the operation of this circuit.
