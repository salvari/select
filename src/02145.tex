What purpose does the TRIAC serve in this circuit?

$$\epsfbox{02145x01.eps}$$

Why use a TRIAC at all?  Why not just use the switch to directly handle load current as in this next circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The difference between these two circuits is a matter of switch currents.  If you understand how a TRIAC works, the answer to this question should not be too difficult to figure out on your own.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A benefit of this circuit that is easy to miss is the TRIAC's ability to provide {\it zero crossing turn-off}.  Discuss why this might be important when controlling power to inductive loads.
