%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This means the difference between no-load output voltage and full-load output voltage is 2\% of the full-load output voltage.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to look up the formula for calculating voltage regulation percentage.  Notice how I did not simply ask them to regurgitate a formula; rather, I presented a realistic figure for them to interpret.  When at all possible, try to format your questions in this sort of practical context!

%INDEX% Voltage regulation, percentage
