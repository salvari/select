Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03713x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_2$ fails open (collector-to-emitter):
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails shorted (collector-to-emitter):
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Reluctor coil $L_1$ fails open:

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_2$ fails open (collector-to-emitter): {\it No current through $T_1$ primary or secondary, no high-voltage pulses across $T_1$ secondary, full 12 volts (constant) across $C_1$, no current through any terminal of $Q_1$, voltage pulses still seen across $L_1$, no spark at spark plug.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails shorted (collector-to-emitter): {\it Constant current through $T_1$ primary, no high-voltage pulses across $T_1$ secondary, nearly 0 volts across $C_1$, voltage pulses still seen across $L_1$, no spark at spark plug.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted: {\it Constant current through $T_1$ primary, no high-voltage pulses across $T_1$ secondary, nearly 0 volts across $C_1$, normal voltage pulses across $L_1$, no spark at spark plug.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails open: {\it Excessive voltage pulses seen at $Q_1$ collector (with respect to ground), very rapid failure of $Q_1$ and possibly $Q_2$.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Reluctor coil $L_1$ fails open: {\it No current through $T_1$ primary or secondary, no high-voltage pulses across $T_1$ secondary, full 12 volts (constant) across $C_1$, full 12 volts (constant) across $Q_2$ collector-to-emitter, no voltage pulses seen across $L_1$, no spark at spark plug.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
