Calculate the power gain of this circuit, if R1 has a resistance of 1 k$\Omega$, R2 has a resistance of 5.1 k$\Omega$, and the load has a resistance of 10 k$\Omega$:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$A_P =$ 0.261

Follow-up question: what {\it unit} does this figure have, if any?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should readily recognize this circuit from their education in basic DC circuits.  Though it may seem strange to calculate the "gain" of a completely passive and indeed {\it dissipative} circuit, it is entirely valid.

Discuss with your students the maximum and minimum possible power gain values for a circuit of this type.  Also discuss with them the nature of ratios with regard to units.
