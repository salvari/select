Latch circuits such as the S-R latch and the D latch are often referred to as {\it transparent} digital devices.  Explain what this term means, and why latches are classified as such.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "transparent" digital device is one whose outputs immediately and asynchronously (transparently) follow the input signal(s) when enabled.  By contrast, many other digital devices are {\it synchronous}, meaning their outputs follow the inputs only at specified times (at the command of a "clock" signal).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The term "transparent" becomes more meaningful when latches and flip-flops are compared with one another.
