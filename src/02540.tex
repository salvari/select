%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Choose both positive input voltage values and negative input voltage values, so that students may predict and measure the output of this circuit under both types of conditions.  The choice of diodes is not critical, as any rectifier diodes will work.  The two resistor values should be equal, and at least as high as the potentiometer value.  I recommend a 10 k$\Omega$ potentiometer and 15 k$\Omega$ resistors.

A good follow-up question to ask is what would be required to change the polarity of this half-wave precision rectifier circuit.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
