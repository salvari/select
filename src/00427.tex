%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

These transformers are connected in an {\it open-Delta} configuration.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Understanding the open-Delta configuration is made easier if students first understand the robustness of the regular Delta configuration: how it continues to provide true three-phase power with no degradation in line voltage in the event of a winding failure.  Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such a configuration with your students.
