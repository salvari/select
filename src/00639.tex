Calculate the magnitude and phase shift of the current through this inductor, taking into consideration its intrinsic winding resistance:

$$\epsfbox{00639x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00639}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

${\bf I} =$ 7.849 mA $\angle$ -87.08$^{o}$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Inductors are the least "pure" of any reactive component, due to significant quantities of resistance in the windings.  Discuss this fact with your students, and what it means with reference to choosing inductors versus capacitors in circuit designs that could use either.
