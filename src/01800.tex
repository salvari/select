When a circuit designer needs a circuit to provide a time delay, he or she almost always chooses an RC circuit instead of an LR circuit.  Explain why this is.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Capacitors are generally cheaper and easier to work with than inductors for making time delay circuits.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer given here is purposely minimal.  You should ask your students to give responses more thoughtful than this!  Ask them why capacitors are cheaper than inductors.  Ask them to explain what is meant by "easier to work with," in technical terms.

%INDEX% Capacitors versus inductors, use in time constant circuits
%INDEX% Inductors versus capacitors, use in time constant circuits
