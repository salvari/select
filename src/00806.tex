If this wire (between the magnet poles) is moved in an upward direction, what polarity of voltage will the meter indicate?

$$\epsfbox{00806x01.eps}$$

Describe the factors influencing the magnitude of the voltage induced by motion, and determine whether this is an example of an electric {\it motor} or an electric {\it generator}.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The voltmeter will indicate a negative voltage in this {\it generator} example.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain their answers regarding factors that influence voltage magnitude.  Where did they obtain their information?  Are there any mathematical formulae relating these factors to induced voltage?
