An electric motor is used to power a large conveyor belt.  Before the motor actually starts, a warning siren activates to alert workers of the conveyor's forthcoming action.  The following relay circuit is supposed to accomplish both tasks (motor control plus siren alert):

$$\epsfbox{03147x01.eps}$$

Unfortunately, there is a problem somewhere in this circuit.  Instead of activating the siren before starting the motor, there is silence.  The motor's start is still delayed by the correct amount of time, but the siren never makes a sound.  Identify some possible causes of this problem.  Also, identify portions of the circuit you know to be functioning properly.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This circuit provides students an opportunity to analyze the workings of a delayed-start motor control circuit, where some other action (a siren in this case) takes place during the motor's delay.  Have your students present both their analyses and the methods behind the analyses as you work through this question with them.
