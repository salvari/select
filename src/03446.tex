Determine which way the movable iron piece needs to go in order to {\it brighten} the light bulb in this circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03446x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 03446}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The movable piece needs to move to the {\it left}, creating a larger air gap between the poles of the U-shaped inductor core.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is an exercise in applying practical electromagnetic theory (namely, reluctance of an iron/air flux path) to inductance and inductive reactance.  Ask your students to explain their reasoning step-by-step as they give their answers to this question.
