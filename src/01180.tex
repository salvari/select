A student builds this transistor amplifier circuit on a solderless "breadboard":

$$\epsfbox{01180x01.eps}$$

The purpose of the potentiometer is to provide an adjustable DC bias voltage for the transistor, so it may be operated in Class-A mode.  After some adjustment of this potentiometer, the student is able to obtain good amplification from the transistor (signal generators and oscilloscopes have been omitted from the illustration for simplicity).

Later, the student accidently adjusts the power supply voltage to a level beyond the JFET's rating, destroying the transistor.  Re-setting the power supply voltage back where the student began the experiment and replacing the transistor, the student discovers that the biasing potentiometer must be re-adjusted to achieve good Class-A operation.

Intrigued by this discovery, the student decides to replace this transistor with a third (of the same part number, of course), just to see if the biasing potentiometer needs to be adjusted again for good Class-A operation.  It does.  

Explain why this is so.  Why must the gate biasing potentiometer be re-adjusted every time the transistor is replaced, even if the replacement transistor(s) are of the exact same type?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This amplifier circuit uses {\it gate bias}, which is a notoriously unstable method of biasing a JFET amplifier circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain exactly what it is that causes the Q point of this amplifier circuit to change with each new transistor.  Is it something in the transistor itself, or in some other part of the circuit?  

Given the instability of gate biasing, should this method be used in mass-produced amplifier circuits?  Ask your students to elaborate on why or why not.
