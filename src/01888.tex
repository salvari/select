%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Generating and distributing AC power in three-phase form is more efficient than if it were done in single-phase form.

Please do not accept the given answer as a student response!  This answer is very shallow, not communicating much meaning.  Ask your students to explain {\it why} polyphase power systems enjoy greater efficiencies than monophase power systems.  There is more than one correct answer to this question!
