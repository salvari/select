A generator is coupled to a bicycle mechanism, so that a person can generate their own electricity:

$$\epsfbox{02172x01.eps}$$

The person pedaling this bicycle/generator notices that it becomes more difficult to pedal when the generator is connected to a load such as a light bulb, or when it is charging a battery.  When the generator is open-circuited, however, it is very easy to spin.  Explain why this is, in terms of {\it work} and energy transfer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The energy consumed by the load must be supplied by whatever mechanical source turns the generator.  In this case, the source is the human being pedaling the bicycle.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what would it mean if a generator required no physical effort to turn while it was powering an electrical load?

Discuss how the Law of Energy Conservation relates to this scenario.
