Determine the polarity of the operational amplifier's output voltage (at test point TP1), with respect to ground, as the magnet is moved {\it toward} the coil as shown.  Assume the magnet will be moved fast enough to generate an induced voltage sufficient to overcome the comparator's hysteresis and saturate the output.  Your answer should simply be either {\it ``positive''} or {\it ``negative''}:

Also, draw the symbol for a bipolar junction transistor inside the circle in such a way that the lamp will energize when the magnet is moved in this direction.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I recommend giving 4 points for correct polarity, and 4 points for the correct transistor symbol orientation:
