Determine the equivalent parallel-connected resistor and inductor values for this series circuit:

$$\epsfbox{00855x01.eps}$$

Also, express the total impedance of either circuit (since they are electrically equivalent to one another, they should have the same total impedance) in {\it complex form}.  That is, express ${\bf Z}$ as a quantity with both a magnitude and an angle.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_{parallel} =$ 2092 $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$L_{parallel} =$ 1.325 H

\vskip 10pt

${\bf Z_{total}} =$ 1772 $\Omega$ $\angle$ 32.14$^{o}$
