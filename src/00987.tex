%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to describe the biasing of the gate-channel junction inside the transistor when the switch is closed.  Is this PN junction forward-biased, or reverse-biased?  What does this biasing do inside the transistor to interrupt current to the LED?

Note that there is no resistor shown in this circuit, because many small-signal JFETs have values of $I_{DSS}$ within the operating range of common LEDs.  In other words, the JFET itself acts as a current-limiting device to protect the LED.
