What difference will it make if the battery in this circuit is reversed in direction?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The choice of battery "polarity" in a simple light bulb circuit makes no difference at all.  In either case, the light bulb will energize when the switch is closed.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that not all electrical loads are "non-polarized" like an incandescent light bulb.  Some electrical components, such as {\it light-emitting diodes}, are polarity sensitive, and will function only if current goes through them in the proper direction.
