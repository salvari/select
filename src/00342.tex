Calculate the voltmeter voltage in each of these circuits, assuming the wiper position is 25\% up from the bottom:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Voltmeter in left-hand circuit = 2.25 volts

Voltmeter in right-hand circuit = 2.13 volts

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students to explain the significance of the reduced voltage from the potentiometer in the presence of a load (the 3.3 k$\Omega$ resistor).  What impact could this effect have on a circuit we might build, where we expect the potentiometer to output a certain voltage corresponding to a specific wiper position?
