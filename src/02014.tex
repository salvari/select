%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

For linear power supplies (those designs having a transformer-rectifier-filter topology), the parameters determining ripple frequency are line frequency and rectification pulses.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note that I did not simply say the ripple frequency is equal to line frequency for half-wave rectification and double the line frequency for full-wave.  Such an answer is misleading, since it completely ignores polyphase AC rectification!
