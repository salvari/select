Predict how the operation of this regulated power supply circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03771x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Rectifying diode $D_3$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Rectifying diode $D_4$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Zener diode $D_5$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Operational amplifier $U_1$ fails with output saturated positive:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails open (collector-to-emitter):
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open: {\it Output voltage falls to zero after filter capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ discharge.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Rectifying diode $D_3$ fails open: {\it No effect seen at no load, regulation falters sooner as load gets heavier.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Rectifying diode $D_4$ fails shorted: {\it Fuse may blow, diode $D_2$ may fail due to overheating (and quickly blow the fuse if it also fails shorted).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it Output voltage falls to zero after filter capacitor $C_2$ discharges.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Zener diode $D_5$ fails open: {\it Output voltage rises to nearly full (unregulated) value.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Operational amplifier $U_1$ fails with output saturated positive: {\it Output voltage rises to nearly full (unregulated) value.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails open (collector-to-emitter): {\it Output voltage falls to zero after filter capacitor $C_2$ discharges.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
