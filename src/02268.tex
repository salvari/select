What purpose does the 1N4001 diode serve in this circuit?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The diode serves to establish a small bias voltage between the two transistors' bases, to minimize the amount of crossover distortion.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Theoretically, the op-amp should be able to handle the "handoff" between the two transistors even with no bias voltage, but since no op-amp has an infinite slew rate, there will be some crossover distortion under load (such as when driving am 8 $\Omega$ speaker).  Placing a bit of DC bias voltage between the two transistor bases helps push them closer to ideal class-B operation, giving the op-amp an easier time of managing the crossover periods.
