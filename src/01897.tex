Design a passive integrator circuit using a resistor and {\it inductor} rather than a resistor and capacitor:

$$\epsfbox{01897x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{01897x02.eps}$$

In addition to completing the inductor circuit schematic, qualitatively state the preferred values of $L$ and $R$ to achieve an output waveform most resembling a true triangle wave.  In other words, are we looking for a large or small inductor; a large or small resistor?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01897x03.eps}$$

For maximum "triangle-like" waveshape, choose a large value for $L$ and a small value for $R$.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain how the choices of values for $L$ and $R$ follow the same reasoning as the choices for $R$ and $C$ in an RC passive integrator circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Explain to your students that although LR integrator circuits are possible, they are almost never used.  RC circuits are much more practical.  Ask them to determine why this is!
