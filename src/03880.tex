JFET amplifiers tend to have less predictable voltage gains than their BJT counterparts.  Since this is considered a disadvantage of JFET amplifiers, identify at least one advantage they enjoy over BJT amplifiers.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

JFET amplifiers draw less input current (i.e. have greater input impedance) than their BJT counterparts.  Their biasing circuits may also be simpler (if self-bias is used).
