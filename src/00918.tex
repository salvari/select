Describe the operation of this diode testing circuit:

$$\epsfbox{00918x01.eps}$$

Identify what the two light-emitting diodes (LEDs) will do when testing these three types of diodes:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Good diode
\item{$\bullet$} Diode failed shorted
\item{$\bullet$} Diode failed open
\medskip

\underbar{file 00918}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Good diode: one LED lit
\item{$\bullet$} Diode failed shorted: both LEDs lit
\item{$\bullet$} Diode failed open: neither LED lit
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: this circuit not only detects the presence of a good diode, but it also has the ability to identify that diode's polarity (which terminal is the cathode, and which terminal is the anode).  Explain how the circuit is able to do this.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This simple yet ingenious circuit (not my design, lest you think I'm conceited) serves the purpose of illustrating diode rectification behavior, and provides a potential project for students to build and test.
