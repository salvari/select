Will the current through the resistor increase or decrease as the capacitor plates are moved closer together?

$$\epsfbox{01843x01.eps}$$

Explain why this happens, with reference to capacitive reactance ($X_C$).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The current will {\it increase}.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: combine the physical capacitance equation and the capacitive reactance equation together to form a new equation that solves for reactance ($X_C$) given all the physical specifications of the capacitor (plate area, spacing, and permittivity) and the applied frequency:

$$C = {\epsilon A \over d} \hbox{\hskip 40pt} X_C = {1 \over {2 \pi f C}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students might be able to guess the correct answer even if they know nothing about capacitive reactance, just by assuming that closer plates means a more complete circuit.  The real answer is more complex than this, though, and that is what you must draw out of the discussion with them.
