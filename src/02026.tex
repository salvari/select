Is it possible to reduce this zener diode voltage regulator circuit to a Th\'evenin equivalent circuit?  Explain why or why not.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Technically, this circuit cannot be reduced to either a Th\'evenin or Norton equivalent, because the zener diode is a {\it nonlinear} component.  However, it {\it is} possible to create two different Th\'evenin equivalent circuits: one representing the circuit when regulating voltage at $V_{zener}$, and the other representing the circuit when the load resistance is below the critical value and the voltage is no longer being regulated:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may protest at the first Th\'evenin equivalent circuit (with a 0 ohm series resistance), because this would be a {\it perfect} voltage source.  In reality, there would be a very small series resistance accounting for the slight voltage "sag" experienced under changing loads within the regulation range, but this is difficult to calculate.
