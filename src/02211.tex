When calculating power in transformer circuits, how do the primary and secondary circuit powers ($P_{primary} = V_{primary}I_{primary}$ and $P_{secondary} = V_{secondary}I_{secondary}$) compare with each other?  Is one greater than the other?  If so, which one, and why?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Ideally, $P_{secondary} = P_{primary}$, although this equivalence is never quite exact.  In practice, $P_{secondary}$ will always be a little bit less than $P_{primary}$.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The simplest answer to this question is that $P_{secondary} = P_{primary}$, and this is a useful principle when doing transformer circuit calculations.  Even when it is not precisely true, it is still a useful tool for checking the veracity of our calculations.  Ask your students why this is.
