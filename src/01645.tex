%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I won't reveal the answer here as to what effect magnitude has on magnetic field strength, but I will suggest a way to test for strength: place the compass at a distance from the coil, where the coil's field has a relatively small effect on the needle position in relation to the ambient magnetic field.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Old solenoid valve coils work very well for this exercise, as do spools of wire with large steel bolts passed through the center.  Students may also wind their own coils using small-gauge magnet wire and a steel bolt.  If the coils are hollow, you may experiment with and without ferrous cores, to demonstrate the effects of a ferromagnetic flux path on the field strength produced.
