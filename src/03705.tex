Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03705x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_3$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Generator winding {\bf C} fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Center connection joining generator windings fails open:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_3$ fails open: {\it Load receives 5-pulse rectification instead of 6-pulse, increased voltage across $D_3$.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Generator winding {\bf C} fails open: {\it Load receives 2-pulse rectification instead of 6-pulse, no current through $D_5$ or $D_6$.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Center connection joining generator windings fails open: {\it No voltage across any diode or across load, no current through any diode or through load.}
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
