Draw the output waveform shape for this circuit, assuming an ideal diode (no forward voltage drop and no reverse leakage):

Follow-up question: how does the clamper circuit "know" how much it needs to bias the AC voltage waveform so that it gets shifted just enough to eliminate reversals of polarity?  Would this circuit function the same if the AC voltage were increased or decreased?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to replace the capacitor with a DC voltage source (oriented in the correct polarity, of course), and explain how the capacitor actually functions as a voltage bias in this clamper circuit.
