%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Calculating the cross-sectional area of the $1 \times 2$ busbar in units of circular mils may be challenging for some students, because an equation directly relating linear dimensions to circular mil area may not be easy to obtain.  However, even in the event that no equation can be found, there is a way to solve for the busbar's area in units of circular mils by observing the answers obtained for the other two conductors' areas.
