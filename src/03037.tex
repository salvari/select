One new technology entering the market is {\it organic light-emitting diodes}, or OLEDs.  Describe what these are, and why they hold so much promise for electronic display device elements.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

An "organic" LED is one made from organic (carbon-containing) molecules instead of crystalline silicon, gallium arsenide, or other more traditional semiconductor substances.  One distinct advantage of these devices is their ease of manufacture, but I'll let you research exactly why (as well as other advantages of these devices).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is destined for obsolescence, as organic LEDs will either become so popular as to lose their novelty ("new technology") or become supplanted by something even better.  But for now (May 2005), they are worthy of their own question in the Socratic Electronics project!
