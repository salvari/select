Calculate the current through the resistor ($I_{R_1}$) and through the load ($I_{load}$), as well as transistor Q2's collector-to-emitter voltage drop ($V_{CE(Q_2)}$).  Assume the use of silicon transistors.  Also, determine whether this current mirror circuit is {\it sourcing} current to the load or {\it sinking} current from the load:

\item{$\bullet$} $I_{R_1}$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{load}$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{CE(Q_2)}$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} {\it Sourcing} or {\it sinking} load current?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{R_1}$ = 13.32 mA
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{load}$ = 13.32 mA
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{CE(Q_2)}$ = 23.34 V
\item{$\bullet$} The current mirror is {\it sinking} current from the load
