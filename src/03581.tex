Determine (qualitatively) what will happen to the following voltages and current in this circuit as {\it frequency} is increased (assume $V_{supply}$ remains constant):

$$\epsfbox{03581x01.eps}$$

$I_{total}$ = {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}?

\vskip 10pt

$V_{R1}$ = {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}? 

\vskip 10pt

$V_{L1}$ = {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}? 

\vskip 10pt

$V_{R2}$ = {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}?
