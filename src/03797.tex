This vocal eliminator circuit used to work just fine, but then one day it stopped eliminating the vocal track.  The tone of the music sounded a bit heavy on the bass, and the vocal track was there when it shouldn't have been there:

$$\epsfbox{03797x01.eps}$$

Identify the following fault possibilities:

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
One resistor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen:

\vskip 15pt

\noindent
One opamp failure that could cause this to happen:

\vskip 15pt

For each of these proposed faults, explain {\it why} the bass tones would be lost.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Please note that the following list is not exhaustive.  That is, other component faults may be possible!

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
One resistor failure (either open or shorted) that could cause this to happen: {\it $R_2$ failed open.}

\vskip 15pt

\noindent
One opamp failure that could cause this to happen: {\it $U_2$ failed.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how they identified their proposed faults, and also how they were able to identify component that {\it must} still be working properly.
