%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why the positions shown in the answer would be superior to the others shown in the question.  Keep in mind principles of heat conduction and the necessity for all parts of the connection to be at sufficient temperature as to melt the solder.  What, precisely, would be wrong with trying to solder this connection in any of the other ways shown?
