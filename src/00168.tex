What disadvantages might there be to using undersized wire in an electrical power distribution system, where electricity is transmitted from generators (sources) to "loads" (devices requiring power) far away?  What might happen if the wires we choose for this application were to have insufficient cross-sectional area?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The effects of undersized wiring are multiple: not only is there inefficiency in the system when conductors are too small, but there are safety hazards as well!
