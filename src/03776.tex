Predict how the input impedance ($Z_{in}$) of this inverting operational amplifier circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03776x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_1$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_2$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Broken wire between $R_1$/$R_2$ junction and inverting opamp input:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Operational amplifier loses power:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the input impedance changes as it does.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it $Z_{in}$ increases to infinity.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_1$: {\it $Z_{in}$ decreases to (nearly) zero.} 
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it $Z_{in}$ increases to (nearly) infinity.} 
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_2$: {\it $Z_{in}$ remains equal in value to $R_1$, as normal.} 
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Broken wire between $R_1$/$R_2$ junction and inverting opamp input: {\it $Z_{in}$ increases to (approximately) $R_1 + R_2$.} 
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Operational amplifier loses power: {\it $Z_{in}$ increases to (nearly) infinity.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
