An important JFET parameter is $V_{GS(off)}$.  Explain what this parameter means, and why it is important to us when selecting a JFET or designing a circuit around one.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{GS(off)}$ is called the {\it cutoff voltage}.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: is $V_{GS(off)}$ approximately the same for all models of JFET, or does it vary from transistor to transistor?  Explain your answer.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what the "GS" subscript stands for in $V_{GS}$.
