Solve for the value of $x$ in the following equations:

$${{x + 5} \over 2} = 20 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = $$

\vskip 10pt

$$6 = \sqrt{x - 2} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = $$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$${{x + 5} \over 2} = 20 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 35$$

$$6 = \sqrt{x - 2} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 38$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for the value of $x$ in each equation.  Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.
