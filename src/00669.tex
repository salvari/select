Suppose the load in this circuit suddenly stops receiving power:

$$\epsfbox{00669x01.eps}$$

Your first step in troubleshooting is to take some voltage measurements:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{AB}$ = 120 V
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{EC}$ = 0 V
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{DC}$ = 120 V
\medskip

Based on these measurements, where do you think the fault is in this circuit, and what type of fault is it?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you determine the most likely failure on your own!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to think of some other possibilities for failure in this circuit besides their first hypothesis.  Also, discuss how you would verify (double-check) all hypotheses, with different meter measurements.
