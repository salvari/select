Calculate the voltage dropped across the load resistor, and the current through the load resistor, for the following load resistance values in this circuit:

Do the "boxed" components in this circuit behave more like a constant voltage source, or a constant current source?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you do the calculations on your own!  Hint: there is a way to figure out the answer without having to calculate all five load resistance scenarios.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question \#1: would you say that voltage sources are typically characterized as having high internal resistances or low internal resistances?  What about current sources?  Explain your answers.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question \#2: although it is difficult to find real devices that approximate ideal current sources, there are a few that do.  An AC device called a "current transformer" is one of them.  Describe which scenario would be the safest from a perspective of shock hazard: an open-circuited current transformer, or a shirt-circuited current transformer.  Why is this?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to make a general prediction about the internal resistance of current sources.  Based on our calculations in this circuit, would you expect voltage sources to have high internal resistance or low internal resistance?  Also ask what constitutes a "high" or a "low" internal resistance for a power source.  Is this a relative determination, or an absolute determination?
