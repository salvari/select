This interesting bridge circuit is a variable phase-shifter.  It works best when the excitation frequency is such that $X_C = R$ in each arm of the bridge:

$$\epsfbox{01599x01.eps}$$

Supposing that $X_C$ does equal $R$ in each arm of the bridge, and that the potentiometer resistance is sufficiently high to limit current through it to a negligible level (in other words, $R_{pot} >> R$).  Calculate the phase shift of $V_{out}$ with respect to the excitation source voltage when:

\item{$\bullet$} The potentiometer wiper is fully left:
\item{$\bullet$} The potentiometer wiper is fully right:
\item{$\bullet$} The potentiometer wiper is perfectly centered:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} The potentiometer wiper is fully left: $\Theta = -45^o$
\item{$\bullet$} The potentiometer wiper is fully right: $\Theta = 45^o$
\item{$\bullet$} The potentiometer wiper is perfectly centered: $\Theta = 0^o$

Follow-up question: this circuit works best with the excitation frequency is such that $X_C = R$.  Write a formula that solves for the necessary frequency ($f$) to achieve this condition given a certain value of $R$.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very interesting circuit to built and test.  You may build one using 1 $\mu$F capacitors, 2.7 k$\Omega$ resistors, and a 100 k$\Omega$ potentiometer that will successfully operate on 60 Hz power-line excitation.

An interesting thing to note about using line power is that any distortions in the excitation sine-wave will become obvious when the potentiometer wiper is turned toward the differentiating position (where $\Theta$ is positive).  If listened to with an audio detector, you may even hear the change in timbre while moving the wiper from one extreme to the other.  If excited by a "clean" sine-wave, however, no change in timbre should be heard because there are no harmonics present.
