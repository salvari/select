In this circuit, where would you expect to measure full battery voltage (between what pairs of test points)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

You should expect to measure full battery voltage with one test lead of your voltmeter touching any of the points along the top wire of the circuit (points A through E), and with the other test lead touching any of the points along the bottom wire of the circuit (points F through J).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This circuit provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the concept of "electrically common" points.  Any points in a circuit directly connected together with wire are considered "electrically common" to each other: a voltage measurement referenced at any one of those points should be identical if referenced any of the other points as well.
