Explain how a {\it moving-coil}, or {\it dynamic} microphone works.  Identify how the principle of electromagnetic induction is put to practical use in this device.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A moving-coil microphone is built just the way the name suggests: a lightweight coil of wire gets moved past a magnet in proportion to vibrations in the air (sound), generating an AC voltage representative of the sound wave oscillations.

Follow-up question: characterize the typical output impedance of this microphone type.  Is it generally considered a low-impedance or a high-impedance type of microphone?  Why do you think this is?
