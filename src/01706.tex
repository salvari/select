%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$10^1 = 10$$

$$10^2 = 100$$

$$10^3 = 1000$$

$$10^4 = 10000$$

$$10^{-1} = {1 \over 10}$$

$$10^{-2} = {1 \over 100}$$

$$10^{-3} = {1 \over 1000}$$

$$10^{-4} = {1 \over 10000}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I have found that many students entering college (at least those entering a technical college in the United States) have a very limited understanding of exponents, especially {\it negative} exponents.  You may find it necessary to review this concept, explaining what a negative exponent is and how it is defined.
