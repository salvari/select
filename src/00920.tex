Shown here is a simple telegraph circuit:

$$\epsfbox{00920x01.eps}$$

Explain why the lamps energize when either pushbutton is actuated, and why they de-energize when both pushbuttons are open (despite there being an unbroken circuit connecting both lamps and both batteries).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The key to understanding this circuit is that both batteries are equal in voltage and opposed in polarity to one another.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a simple circuit, yet practical in its function as a telegraph and as an example of KVL in action.
