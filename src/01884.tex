Calculate the primary winding current (magnitude and phase angle) for this resistively loaded transformer, with a primary inductance of 18 Henrys and a secondary inductance of 36 Henrys:

$$\epsfbox{01884x01.eps}$$

Also, draw an equivalent schematic diagram (with no transformer in it) illustrating the impedance "seen" by the AC power source.  Assume no winding resistance in either transformer winding, and a magnetic coupling coefficient between the two windings of exactly 1.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{primary} = 2.4001 \hbox{ A} \> \angle -0.42^o$

Follow-up question: what is the "step" ratio of this transformer, and is it step-up or step-down?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question illustrates how reflected load impedance is "seen" by the source, and how it interacts with the transformer's intrinsic winding impedance.
