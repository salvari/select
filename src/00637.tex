In this circuit, a series resistor-capacitor network creates a phase-shifted voltage for the "gate" terminal of a power-control device known as a {\it TRIAC}.  All portions of the circuit except for the RC network are "shaded" for de-emphasis:

$$\epsfbox{00637x01.eps}$$

Calculate how many degrees of phase shift the capacitor's voltage is, compared to the total voltage across the series RC network, assuming a frequency of 60 Hz, and a 50\% potentiometer setting.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$E_C$ phase shift = -76.7$^{o}$

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what effect will a change in potentiometer setting have on this phase angle?  Specifically, will increasing the resistance make the phase shift approach -90$^{o}$ or approach 0$^{o}$?

In this question, I purposely omitted any reference to voltage levels, so the students would have to set up part of the problem themselves.  The goal here is to build problem-solving skills.
