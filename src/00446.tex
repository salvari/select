Match the following bipolar transistor illustrations to their respective schematic symbols:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{00446x02.eps}$$
 
\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: identify the terminals on each transistor schematic symbol (base, emitter, and collector).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to ask your students which of these transistor symbols represents the "NPN" type and which represents the "PNP" type.  Although it will be obvious to most from the "sandwich" illustrations showing layers of "P" and "N" type material, this fact may escape the notice of a few students.

It might help to review diode symbols, if some students experience difficulty in matching the designations (PNP versus NPN) with the schematic symbols.
