Find one or two real diodes and bring them with you to class for discussion.  Identify as much information as you can about your diodes prior to discussion:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Polarity (which terminal is cathode and which is anode)
\item{$\bullet$} Forward voltage drop
\item{$\bullet$} Continuous current rating
\item{$\bullet$} Surge current rating
\item{$\bullet$} Continuous power rating
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If possible, find a manufacturer's datasheet for your components (or at least a datasheet for a similar component) to discuss with your classmates.

Be prepared to {\it prove} the forward voltage drop of your diodes in class, by using a multimeter!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to kinesthetically interact with the subject matter.  It may seem silly to have students engage in a "show and tell" exercise, but I have found that activities such as this greatly help some students.  For those learners who are kinesthetic in nature, it is a great help to actually {\it touch} real components while they're learning about their function.  Of course, this question also provides an excellent opportunity for them to practice interpreting component markings, use a multimeter, access datasheets, etc.
