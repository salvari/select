According to the "Ohm's Law" formula for a capacitor, capacitor current is proportional to the {\it time-derivative} of capacitor voltage:

$$i = C {dv \over dt}$$

Another way of saying this is to state that the capacitors {\it differentiate} voltage with respect to time, and express this {\it time-derivative} of voltage as a current.

Suppose we had an oscilloscope capable of directly measuring current, or at least a current-to-voltage converter that we could attach to one of the probe inputs to allow direct measurement of current on one channel.  With such an instrument set-up, we could directly plot capacitor voltage and capacitor current together on the same display:

$$\epsfbox{01900x01.eps}$$

For each of the following voltage waveforms (channel B), plot the corresponding capacitor current waveform (channel A) as it would appear on the oscilloscope screen:

$$\epsfbox{01900x02.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{01900x03.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{01900x04.eps}$$

Note: the amplitude of your current plots is arbitrary.  What I'm interested in here is the {\it shape} of each current waveform!

Follow-up question: what electronic device could perform the function of a "current-to-voltage converter" so we could use an oscilloscope to measure capacitor current?  Be as specific as you can in your answer.

Here, I ask students to relate the instantaneous rate-of-change of the voltage waveform to the instantaneous amplitude of the current waveform.  Just a conceptual exercise in derivatives.
