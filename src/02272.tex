Determine the frequency spectrum for a high-frequency, sine wave "carrier" signal that is {\it amplitude-modulated} (AM) by an audio-frequency signal with a spectrum of its own.  The spectra for these respective waveforms are shown individually:

$$\epsfbox{02272x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02272x02.eps}$$

Plot the modulated signal spectrum here:

$$\epsfbox{02272x04.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to recognize where sidebands come from, and to recognize their symmetry about the carrier peak.

In case anyone happens to ask, the equal scaling of the sidebands around the carrier on the answer spectrum implies a {\it linear} frequency scale.
