I once watched a television advertisement for an electric drill, in which one of the people selling this product claimed it was "double-insulated," to which the other person replied, "So it doesn't get hot in your hand, right?"

What do you think of this comment?  Is this what "double-insulated" means?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

While this advertisement was amusing, it was not very informative.  No, the term "double-insulated" does {\it not} refer to thermal insulation, but rather electrical insulation.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One fact of interest here is that double-insulated tools usually do not have three-prong power plugs.  In other words, they do not need a "ground" wire to ensure operator safety.
