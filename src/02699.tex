Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a dual-voltage, regulated power supply to supply power to the opamp.  Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k$\Omega$ and 100 k$\Omega$ (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).

I have had good success using the following values:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} +V = +12 volts
\item{$\bullet$} -V = -12 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $R_1$ = 10 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} $R_2$ = $R_3$ = 1 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} $R_{pot}$ = 10 k$\Omega$ multi-turn
\item{$\bullet$} $C_1$ = 0.001 $\mu$F or 0.47 $\mu$F
\item{$\bullet$} $L_1$ = 100 mH
\item{$\bullet$} $D_1$ = $D_2$ = 1N4148
\item{$\bullet$} $U_1$ = one-half of LM1458 dual operational amplifier
\medskip

With the presence of the amplitude-limiting diodes $D_1$ and $D_2$, the potentiometer adjustment is not nearly as sensitive as without.  Try removing both diodes to see what happens when there is no amplitude limiting at all!  Students will have to finely adjust the multi-turn potentiometer to achieve a good sine wave (meeting the Barkhausen criterion).  With the diodes in place, however, you may adjust the potentiometer for a loop gain just above unity with the only consequence being slight distortion of the waveform rather than severe distortion.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
