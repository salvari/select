Which components in this partial automobile schematic diagram are guaranteed to share the exact same {\it voltage} by virtue of their connections with each other?  Which components are guaranteed to share the exact same {\it current} by virtue of their connections with each other?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The two headlights are guaranteed to share the same voltage.  So are the two brake lights.  However, the voltage across the brake lights may not be the same as the voltage across the headlights at any given time!

So long as the fusible link is not "blown," the generator and battery will share approximately the same voltage.

The ammeter, fusible link, and generator are all guaranteed to share the same current.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, the important relations between voltage, current, and component connection patterns are explored.  This serves to further define, in practical ways, what the terms "series" and "parallel" really mean.

This question also affords the opportunity of discussing what a "fusible link" is, and how it compares to fuses and circuit breakers as an overcurrent protection device.
