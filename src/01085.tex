Under certain conditions (especially with certain types of loads) it is possible for a simple one-transistor voltage amplifier circuit to oscillate:

$$\epsfbox{01085x01.eps}$$

Explain how this is possible.  What parasitic effects could possibly turn an amplifier into an oscillator?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here is a re-drawn representation of the amplifier circuit, with the base-emitter capacitance shown:

$$\epsfbox{01085x02.eps}$$

Follow-up question: what type of oscillator circuit does this resemble?

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what type(s) of load would tend to make this circuit oscillate more readily than others?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question reinforces a very important lesson in electronic circuit design: parasitic effects may produce some {\it very} unexpected consequences!  Just because you didn't intend for your amplifier circuit to oscillate does not mean than it won't.
