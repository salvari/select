Sketch the harmonic "signature" of a perfect, symmetrical square wave (50\% duty cycle) with a fundamental frequency of 1 kHz.  Be sure to show at least four of the harmonic "peaks" on the spectrum analyzer display:

{\bf This question is intended for exams only and not worksheets!}.

The real test here is to see whether students realize the peaks should all fall on {\it odd} whole-number multiples of 1 kHz.  Any even-numbered harmonic is incorrect for this question, as are any higher-order harmonics greater in amplitude than any lower-order harmonics.
