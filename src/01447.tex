Suppose you need a memory array with 2k $\times$ 4 organization, but all you have on hand are 1k $\times$ 4 memory chips.  Show how you could connect two of them to form the desired array:

$$\epsfbox{01447x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01447}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01447x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: which of the two memory chips shown here stores the first 1024 addresses, and which one stores the next 1024 addresses?  How can you tell?

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: as you can see, the expansion in addresses comes at the expense of losing the ability to simultaneously disable {\it both} memory chips.  Add whatever logic gates are necessary to this circuit to provide a "global" $\overline{CS}$ line for the 2k $\times$ 4 memory array.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to spend some time discussing the follow-up question.  Once again, I've noticed students are prone to memorizing the connection pattern rather than take the time to figure out {\it why} the chips are connected as they are.

%INDEX% Memory expansion, address
%INDEX% Address expansion, memory
