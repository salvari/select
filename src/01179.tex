Calculate the approximate {\it input impedance} ($Z_{in}$) of this amplifier circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01179x01.eps}$$

Also, explain why input impedance is an important factor in amplifier circuits.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Z_{in} =$ 152 k$\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

I won't directly tell you why input impedance is an important factor for amplifier circuits, but I'll give you a hint: {\it Maximum Power Transfer Theorem}.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask you students to compare the input impedance of this amplifier with the load impedance.  Does the transistor "match" impedances like a transformer does?  Ask them to explain both the similarities and the differences between transformers and transistors as impedance-matching devices.
