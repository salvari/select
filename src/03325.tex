%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$2(x + 5) = 36 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 13$$

$$3 = \sqrt{2 - x} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = -7$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for the value of $x$ in each equation.  Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.
