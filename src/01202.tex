Convert the following numbers from binary (base-two) to decimal (base-ten):

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $10_2$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $1010_2$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $10011_2$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $11100_2$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $10111_2$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $101011_2$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $11100110_2$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $10001101011_2$ = 
\medskip

Describe a general, step-by-step procedure for converting binary numbers into decimal numbers.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $10_2$ = $2_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $1010_2$ = $10_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $10011_2$ = $19_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $11100_2$ =  $28_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $10111_2$ =  $23_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $101011_2$ =  $43_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $11100110_2$ = $230_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $10001101011_2$ = $1131_{10}$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The most important part of this question, of course, is the {\it method} of translating binary into decimal.  Don't tell your students how to do this, as there are plenty of good references to be found on the procedure.  If a student cannot research and understand how to convert binary into decimal without your help, they aren't trying hard enough!
