Explain why a sine-wave oscillator circuit requires 360 degrees of total phase shift in order to oscillate.  Why not 180 degrees, 90 degrees, or some other angle?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

360 degrees of phase shift is necessary for regenerative feedback, where the oscillating signal reinforces itself rather than dampens itself.
