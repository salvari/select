When only the most significant bit (MSB) of an R-2R ladder resistor network is activated (all other bits inactive, their switches connecting to ground), the output voltage will be the same, regardless of how many bits the network has:

$$\epsfbox{04000x01.eps}$$

Explain why this output voltage magnitude stands independent of the number of bits (sections) in the R-2R ladder network.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$V_{out} = {V_{ref} \over 2}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The key to understanding the answer is to apply Th\'evenin's theorem to the "inactive" sections of the network.  Here, the unique property of constant output impedance for an R-2R network yields a useful feature when applied to DAC circuitry.
