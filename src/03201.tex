%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Reduced-voltage starting means that less-than-full line voltage is initially applied to a motor when starting, then full voltage is applied later when the motor has reached a certain speed.  This is done to mitigate inrush currents, which may be incredibly high for large electric motors.
