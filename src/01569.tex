Industrial {\it control power transformers} are used to step down 480 or 240 volts to a level more acceptable for relay control circuitry: usually 120 volts.  Some control power transformers are built with multiple primary windings, to facilitate connection to either a 480 volt or 240 volt AC power source:

Such transformers are usually advertised as having "240 $\times$ 480" primary windings, the "$\times$" symbol representing two independent windings with four connection points (H1 through H4).

Show the connections on the four "H" terminals necessary for 240 volt operation, and also for 480 volt operation, on the following illustrations:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This type of transformer is {\it very} common in industrial control systems.  Discuss with your students why the primary winding terminals are arranged as they are (H1-H3-H2-H4), to facilitate near-terminal jumpering with metal clips.
