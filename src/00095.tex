What will happen to the brightness of the light bulb as the iron core is moved away from the wire coil in this circuit?  Explain why this happens.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The light bulb will glow brighter when the iron core is moved away from the wire coil, due to the change in inductive reactance (X$_{L}$).

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what circuit failure(s) could cause the light bulb to glow brighter than it should?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One direction you might want to lead your students in with this question is how AC power may be controlled using this principle.  Controlling AC power with a variable {\it reactance} has a definite advantage over controlling AC power with a variable {\it resistance}: less wasted energy in the form of heat.
