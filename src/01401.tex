Supposed we used J-K flip-flops with asynchronous inputs (Preset and Clear) to build a counter:

$$\epsfbox{01401x01.eps}$$

With the asynchronous lines paralleled as such, what are we able to make the counter do now that we weren't before we had asynchronous inputs available to us?

\underbar{file 01401}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Now, we are able to force the counter to zero (0000) or full count (1111) at will.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why this feature might be useful.  Can they think of any applications involving a counter circuit where it would be practical to force its output to either zero or full count regardless of the clock's action?

%INDEX% Counter, synchronous
%INDEX% Asynchronous input, flip-flop
