There are several sources of information on galvanometers, both historical and modern.  I leave it to you to do the research and present your findings.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is possible to make a crude galvanometer from a large audio speaker, using the voice coil/cone assembly as the moving element.  Using a small laser and a mirror, it should be easy to construct a light-beam galvanometer, for greater sensitivity.  This could be a fun and educational classroom experiment!
