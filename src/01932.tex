%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Being able to design a circuit using a BJT as a switch is a valuable skill for technicians and engineers alike to have.  The circuit shown in this question is not the only possibility, but it is the simplest.

Remind your students that the equation for calculating BJT power dissipation is as follows:

$$P_Q = I_C \Bigl(V_{CE} + {V_{BE} \over \beta}\Bigr)$$

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
