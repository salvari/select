The following graph is a family of characteristic curves for a particular transistor:

$$\epsfbox{02245x01.eps}$$

Draw the load line and identify the Q-point on that load line for a common-emitter amplifier circuit using this transistor:

$$\epsfbox{02245x02.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02245x03.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: determine what would happen to the Q-point if resistor $R_2$ (the 2.2 k$\Omega$ biasing resistor) were to fail open.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to relate their existing knowledge of common-emitter circuit DC analysis to the concept of load lines and Q-points.  Ask your students to share their analysis techniques with the whole class.
