The truth table shown here is for a 4-line to 16-line {\it binary decoder} circuit:

$$\epsfbox{04054x01.eps}$$

For each of the sixteen output lines, there is a Boolean SOP expression describing its function.  Just for example, write the Boolean expressions for output lines 2, 11, and 14.

\underbar{file 04054}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Output line 2: $\overline{A}B \overline{C} \> \overline{D}$

Output line 11: $A B \overline{C} D$

Output line 14: $\overline{A} B C D$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: based on what you see here, what kind of logic gate circuitry is a decoder such as this comprised of?  You don't have to actually draw a schematic diagram, but just generally describe the circuitry necessary to implement sixteen different SOP expressions.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing really complex or tricky here.  Just a straightforward application of Boolean SOP expressions.
