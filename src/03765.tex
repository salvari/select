Predict how the operation of this operational amplifier circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Specifically, identify whether the output voltage ($V_{out}$) will move in a positive direction (closer to the +V rail) or in a negative direction (closer to ground).  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_5$ fails shorted (collector-to-emitter): {\it $V_{out}$ goes negative.}

\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_6$ fails shorted (collector-to-emitter): {\it $V_{out}$ goes positive.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ goes negative.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
