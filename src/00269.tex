Determine how much voltage a voltmeter would indicate when connected between the following points in this faulted circuit:

$$\epsfbox{00269x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB1-1 and TB1-3
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB1-4 and TB2-4
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB2-3 and TB2-1
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB1-1 and TB2-1
\medskip

Hint: it might help to draw a neat schematic diagram of this circuit first, with all connection points labeled!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB1-1 and TB1-3 ({\it Voltmeter measures 9 volts})
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB1-4 and TB2-4 ({\it Voltmeter measures 9 volts})
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB2-3 and TB2-1 ({\it Voltmeter measures 0 volts})
\item{$\bullet$} Between TB1-1 and TB2-1 ({\it Voltmeter measures 9 volts})
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students this question: how does the break in the wire affect electrical "commonality" between TB1-4 and TB2-4?
