%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The resonant frequency of this tank circuit may be increased by substituting a smaller-value capacitor in for the capacitor value it presently has.

\vskip 10pt

Note: this is not the only way to increase this circuit's resonant frequency!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students to explain another method for increasing the resonant frequency of this tank circuit, besides decreasing the value of the capacitor.  Discuss how any of these alterations to the circuit affect the typical energy "cycle" between kinetic and potential forms, and {\it why} they lead to an increased frequency.
