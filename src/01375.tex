Draw the schematic diagram for a four-bit binary "up" counter circuit, using J-K flip-flops.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The circuit shown here is not the only valid solution!

$$\epsfbox{01375x01.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what {\it other} configuration of J-K flip-flops could be used to make a four bit binary "up" counter?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to discuss the follow-up question with your students.  It is important that they understand how to make both "up" and "down" counters using J-K flip-flops, and that there are two basic methods to make each direction of counter.
