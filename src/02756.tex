Determine the logic levels (either "high" or "low") at each of the test points in this circuit with the toggle switch in the open position, as well as the status of the transistor and LED:

$$\epsfbox{02756x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP1}$ = ({\it high} or {\it low}?)
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP2}$ = ({\it high} or {\it low}?)
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP3}$ = ({\it high} or {\it low}?)
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP4}$ = ({\it high} or {\it low}?)
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor = ({\it on} or {\it off}?) 
\item{$\bullet$} LED = ({\it on} or {\it off}?)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP1}$ = {\it high}
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP2}$ = {\it high}
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP3}$ = {\it low}
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP4}$ = {\it high}
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor = {\it off} 
\item{$\bullet$} LED = {\it off}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question applies the concepts of "high" and "low" voltage signals to a simple transistor circuit, reviewing transistor operation in the process.
