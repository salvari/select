Something is wrong with this building alarm system circuit.  The alarm siren refuses to energize even when all windows and doors are opened:

$$\epsfbox{02884x01.eps}$$

Using your logic probe, you measure a high signal at TP1, a high signal at TP15, and a low signal at TP8 with all windows and doors propped open, and with the key switch in the "normal" position.  From this information, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit.  Then, choose one of those possible faults and explain why you think it could be to blame.  The circuit elements you identify as possibly faulted can be wires, traces, and connections as well as components.  Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note: the following answers are not exhaustive.  There may be more circuit elements possibly at fault!

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Circuit elements that are possibly faulted
\item{1.} $U_3$ output stuck low
\item{2.} $U_4$ output stuck low
\item{3.} LED inside SSR failed shorted (causing voltage at TP8 to be too low to be recognized as a high state)
\item{3.} $V_{DD}$ power lost to pullup resistors $R_1$-$R_4$
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to identify means by which they could confirm suspected circuit elements, by measuring something other than what has already been measured.

Troubleshooting scenarios are always good for stimulating class discussion.  Be sure to spend plenty of time in class with your students developing efficient and logical diagnostic procedures, as this will assist them greatly in their careers.
