%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Pushbutton switches are recommended over toggle switches for demonstrating a latch circuit.  When the contacts are momentary, the latching characteristics of the circuit becomes more evident to see.

If students use LEDs to indicate the $Q$ and $\overline{Q}$ output states, they may experience trouble with the circuit not latching as it should.  This is an excellent example of gate output {\it loading}, and the importance of proper logic level voltages.  If such problems are encountered, advise the student(s) to use over-sized (too large) LED dropping resistors.  This will cause the LEDs to be dim, but restore workable voltage levels so that "high" output states are actually interpreted as "high" when fed back to the gate inputs.
