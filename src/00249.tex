Something has failed in this circuit, because the light bulb does not light up when the switch is closed:

What type(s) of transformer fault(s) would cause a problem like this, and how might you verify using a multimeter?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The most common type of transformer fault causing a problem like this is an {\it open} winding.  This is very easy to check using a multimeter (I'll let you answer this part of the question!).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Of course, faults in this circuit having nothing to do with the transformer could also prevent the light bulb from lighting.  If time permits, it would be good to analyze a few failure scenarios with your students, challenging them to locate the source of the trouble as efficiently as possible.
