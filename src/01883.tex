Calculate the primary winding current (magnitude and phase angle) for this resistively loaded isolation transformer, with primary and secondary inductances of 18 Henrys each:

$$\epsfbox{01883x01.eps}$$

Also, draw an equivalent schematic diagram (with no transformer in it) illustrating the impedance "seen" by the AC power source.  Assume no winding resistance in either transformer winding, and a magnetic coupling coefficient between the two windings of exactly 1.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{primary} = 1.2001 \hbox{ A} \> \angle -0.84^o$

Follow-up question: what kind of impedance (predominantly resistive, inductive, or capacitive) does the AC source "see" in this circuit?  Contrast this against a situation with no load connected to the transformer at all.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question illustrates how reflected load impedance is "seen" by the source, and how it interacts with the transformer's intrinsic winding impedance.
