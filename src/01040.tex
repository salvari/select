What does it actually mean to obtain a solution for a "simultaneous" system of equations?  For example, if $2x + y = 7$ and $x - y = -1$, what do the solution values ($x = 2$ ; $y = 3$) represent?

If we were to graph both these linear equations on a Cartesian ($x$, $y$) coordinate system, where would the solution (2,3) be located on the graph?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The solutions for a system of equations represent a unique combination of values that satisfy all equations in that system.  For a two variable system, the solution is the intersection of two lines.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Many students have difficulty grasping the significance of systems of equations.  Discuss the meaning of equations, and systems of equations, with your students, making sure that the concept of simultaneity (solutions satisfying all equations at once) is made clear.
