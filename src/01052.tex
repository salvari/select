How does the behavior of a {\it zener diode} differ substantially from that of a normal (rectifying) diode?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Zener diodes break down at substantially lower reverse voltages than rectifying diodes, and their breakdown voltages are predictable.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask students what zener diodes would likely be used for.  Why would we need or desire a device with a stable breakdown voltage?
