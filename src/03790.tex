Identify what type of passive filter circuit this is, and then sketch a schematic diagram for an equivalent circuit using a switched-capacitor network instead of a resistor:

$$\epsfbox{03790x01.eps}$$

Also, write an equation describing the cutoff frequency in terms of switching frequency and capacitor values.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it lowpass} filter circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03790x02.eps}$$

$$f_{-3dB} = {{f_{switch} C_1} \over {2 \pi C_2}}$$

\vskip 10pt

Note: in order for this circuit to be practical, $f_{switch} >> f_{signal}$.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question asks students to substitute a switched capacitor network for the fixed resistor in the original filter circuit.  Similarly, algebraic substitution is required to derive the equation for cutoff frequency.
