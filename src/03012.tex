The 74HC154 is a high-speed CMOS (TTL-compatible) integrated circuit decoder with four input lines and sixteen output lines:

$$\epsfbox{03012x01.eps}$$

Identify the logic states of all output terminals given the input conditions shown.

\vskip 10pt

Now, identify the logic states for the same circuit, this time with a square wave (on/off pulse) logic signal applied to the enable terminals:

$$\epsfbox{03012x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 03012}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In the first scenario with the enable lines grounded, output \#11 will be low, with all other outputs high.  In the second scenario with a square wave signal input to the enable lines, output \#11 will pulse while all other outputs remain in the high state.
