An automotive engineer wants to design a logic circuit that prohibits the engine in a car from being started unless the driver is pressing the clutch pedal while turning the ignition switch to the "start" position.  The purpose of this feature will be to prevent the car from moving forward while being started if ever the transmission is accidently left in gear.

Suppose we designate the status of the ignition switch "start" position with the Boolean variable $S$ (1 = start; 0 = run or off), and the clutch pedal position with the Boolean variable $C$ (1 = clutch pedal depressed; 0 = clutch pedal in normal, unpressed position).  Write a Boolean expression for the starter solenoid status, given the start switch ($S$) and clutch ($C$) statuses.  Then, draw a logic gate circuit to implement this Boolean function.

Boolean expression:

$$SC$$

Logic gate circuit:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is not a very complicated function to express or implement, the point of this question being mostly to introduce students to a practical use of logic gates and Boolean algebra.
