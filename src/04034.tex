%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "phasor" is a complex-number representation of an electrical quantity, such as voltage, current, or impedance.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The ingredient of {\it complex} must be present in any definition of a phasor.  A phasor, while it may be classified as a type of {\it vector} (possessing both magnitude and direction), is not the same as the vectors commonly used in other areas of physics (e.g. force vectors, electric/magnetic field vectors, etc.).
