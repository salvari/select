Identify what type of filter circuit this is ({\it band-pass}, or {\it band-stop}), its resonant frequency ($f_r$), and its two cutoff frequencies ($f_{c1}$ and $f_{c2}$):

$$\epsfbox{03635x01.eps}$$

Filter type =

\vskip 10pt

$f_r$ = 

\vskip 10pt

$f_{c1}$ =

\vskip 10pt

$f_{c2}$ = 

\underbar{file 03635}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Filter type = {\it band-pass}

\vskip 10pt

$f_r$ = 7.153 kHz

\vskip 10pt

$f_{c1}$ = 6.904 kHz

\vskip 10pt

$f_{c2}$ = 7.403 kHz
