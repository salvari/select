Draw the necessary connecting wires between flip-flops so that serial data is shifted from {\it right to left} instead of left to right as you may be accustomed to seeing in a shift register schematic:

$$\epsfbox{01471x01.eps}$$

Be sure to also note where data enters this shift register, and where data exits.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very simple question to answer.  I present it here primarily so that students start thinking about how to {\it change} the direction of shift in a shift register circuit: a prelude to bidirectional shift register circuits.

%INDEX% Shift register, direction of shift
