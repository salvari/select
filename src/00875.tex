Although the following symbol is generally interpreted as an operational amplifier ("op-amp"), it may also be used to represent a {\it comparator}:

$$\epsfbox{00875x01.eps}$$

What is the difference between a comparator such as the model LM319, and a true operational amplifier such as the model LM324?  Are the two devices interchangeable, or is there any significant difference despite the exact same schematic symbols?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Comparators are designed for {\it open-loop} operation only (no feedback), while operational amplifiers are designed to perform well with feedback.  For many simple applications, though, a true op-amp does a reasonable job as a comparator.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer to this question invokes a couple of terms your students may not be familiar with yet: "open-loop" and "feedback".  Discuss these terms with your students, asking them first if they were able to arrive at definitions for them.
