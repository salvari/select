Assume that the comparator in this circuit is only capable of "swinging" its output to within 1 volt of its power supply rail voltages.  Calculate the upper and lower threshold voltages, given the resistor values shown:

$$\epsfbox{02662x01.eps}$$

$V_{UT}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{LT}$ = 

\vskip 10pt

\underbar{file 02662}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{UT} =$ +2.093 volts

\vskip 10pt

$V_{LT} =$ -2.093 volts

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

As many opamps and comparators are incapable of rail-to-rail output swings, this question is quite realistic.
