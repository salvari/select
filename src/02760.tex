Identify the type of logic gate shown in this schematic diagram, and explain why it has the name it does:

$$\epsfbox{02760x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02760}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an {\bf AND} gate, so named because its output goes high only if input A is high {\it and} input B is high.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: show how a light-emitting diode could be connected to the output of this logic gate to provide visual indication of its output state.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: show how this logic gate could drive a high-current load such as a solenoid or an electric motor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Your students should have no great difficulty identifying this particular logic gate if they have a good digital electronics reference book at their disposal.
