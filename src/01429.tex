Design a voltage divider circuit that splits the power supply voltage into the following percentages:

$$\epsfbox{01429x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01429}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There are many different sets of resistor values that will achieve this design goal, but here is one pair of resistance values that will suffice:

$$250 \> \Omega \hbox{ and } 750 \> \Omega$$
