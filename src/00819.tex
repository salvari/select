If this alternator is spun at 4500 RPM (revolutions per minute), what will be the frequency of its output voltage?

$$\epsfbox{00819x01.eps}$$

Hint: how many cycles of AC are produced for every revolution of the rotor?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f =$ 75 Hz

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should realize that there is one cycle of AC voltage produced for every revolution of the rotor shaft.  From that point, the problem is simply a matter of unit conversions.
