Determine what a digital voltmeter (DVM) would indicate if connected between the following points in this circuit:

\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on A, black lead on H
\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on C, black lead on G
\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on F, black lead on B
\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on F, black lead on A

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here is a schematic diagram to help you:

$$\epsfbox{00344x02.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on A, black lead on H = +24 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on C, black lead on G = +12 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on F, black lead on B = -12 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Red lead on F, black lead on A = -18 volts
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) is very easily explored in real life with a set of batteries and "jumper wire" connections.  Encourage your students to build battery circuits like the one shown in this question, to be able to see the results for themselves!

One really nice feature of digital multimeters (DMMs) is the ability to register negative as well as positive quantities.  This feature is very useful when teaching Kirchhoff's Laws, with the {\it algebraic} (sign-dependent) summation of voltages and currents.
