Examine this schematic diagram:

$$\epsfbox{00067x01.eps}$$

Now, without moving the following components, show how they may be connected together with wires to form the same circuit depicted in the schematic diagram above:

One of the more difficult skills for students to develop is the ability to translate a nice, neat schematic diagram into a messy, real-world circuit, and visa-versa.  Developing this skill requires lots of practice.

It is very worthwhile for students to discuss how they solve problems such as these with each other.  For those students who have trouble visualizing shapes, a simple hint or "trick" to use when translating schematics to illustrations or visa-versa may be invaluable.
