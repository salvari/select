%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

0.7899 $\Omega$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Solving this problem requires several concepts be integrated: calculating the resistance of a wire given its metal type, length, and gauge; converting between different temperature units; and calculating shift in resistance due to temperature.
