Explain why DAC circuits based on R-2R ladder networks are more popular than binary-weighed resistor networks.  Either one will work well if properly designed and built, so why would one design be more widely manufactured?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The answer to this question has to do with business and production-line priorities.  Just because two designs work equally well in theory does not mean they are equally easy to mass-produce!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is important for your students to grasp basic principles and practices of business, because that is the arena their technical skills will most likely find challenge and value.  This question is a way to get your students thinking about real-life, practical manufacturing concerns that go beyond basic principles of electrical theory.
