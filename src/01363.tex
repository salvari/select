Determine the final output states over time for the following circuit, built from D-type gated latches:

$$\epsfbox{01363x01.eps}$$

At what specific times in the pulse diagram does the final output assume the input's state?  How does this behavior differ from the normal response of a D-type latch?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01363x02.eps}$$

The final output assumes the same logic state as the input only when the enable input signal (B) {\it transitions} from "high" to "low".

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note that by adding another latch, the overall behavior only slightly resembles the behavior of a D-type latch.  With the addition of the second latch, we've changed this circuit into a {\it flip-flop}, specifically of the {\it master-slave} variety.

%INDEX% D-type flip-flop, master-slave
