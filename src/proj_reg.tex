Your project is to design and build a DC voltage regulator capable of regulating 24 volts DC (input) to an adjustable output with a range of {\it at least} 3 to 20 volts, with a maximum continuous current rating of 2 amps.  Your circuit must be built entirely from discrete components (no integrated circuits), and regulate voltage to within 10\%, from no load to full load.  Your team is responsible for selecting and testing the circuit design.

A circuit such as this would typically follow an AC-DC power supply (transformer, rectifier, and filter).
