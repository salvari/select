%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts.  Have students calculate the necessary current-limiting resistor for their LEDs based on measured values of $V_{forward}$ for the LED (using a multimeter with a "diode-check" function).  Let students research the typical forward current for their LED from an appropriate datasheet.  Any LED should suffice for this activity.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
