Draw a schematic diagram showing a DC generator charging a battery, and another schematic showing a battery discharging into a resistive load.  Be sure to include arrows in your drawing showing the direction of charging current.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question \#1: how must the battery and generator voltages compare in order for the battery to have current forced "backward" through it?

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question \#2: which is the {\it source} component, and which is the {\it load} component in a circuit where a generator charges a secondary-cell battery?  Explain your reasoning.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is very important for students to understand the direction of current through a battery, both when charging and when discharging.  A helpful perspective on this topic is to think of the battery either as being a {\it source} of electrical energy versus being a {\it load}.  Under which conditions (charging or discharging) is the battery playing the role of source versus load?
