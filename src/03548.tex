Capacitors store energy in the form of an electric field.  We may calculate the energy stored in a capacitance by integrating the product of capacitor voltage and capacitor current ($P = IV$) over time, since we know that power is the rate at which work ($W$) is done, and the amount of work done to a capacitor taking it from zero voltage to some non-zero amount of voltage constitutes energy stored ($U$):

$$P = {dW \over dt}$$

$$dW = P \> dt$$

$$U = W = \int P \> dt$$

Find a way to substitute capacitance ($C$) and voltage ($V$) into the integrand so you may integrate to find an equation describing the amount of energy stored in a capacitor for any given capacitance and voltage values.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$U = {1 \over 2}CV^2$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The integration required to obtain the answer is commonly found in calculus-based physics textbooks, and is an easy (power rule) integration.
