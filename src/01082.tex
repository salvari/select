Identify the type of oscillator circuit shown in this schematic diagram, and explain the purpose of the tank circuit ($L_1$ and $C_1$):

$$\epsfbox{01082x01.eps}$$

Also, write the equation describing the operating frequency of this type of oscillator circuit.

\underbar{file 01082}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it Hartley} oscillator circuit, and the tank circuit establishes its frequency of operation.

$$f = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{L_1 C_1}}}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: calculate the operating frequency of this oscillator circuit if $L_1$ = 330 mH and $C_1$ = 0.15 $\mu$F.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to describe the amount of phase shift the tank circuit provides to the feedback signal.  Also, ask them to explain how the oscillator circuit's natural frequency may be altered.
