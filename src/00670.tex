Follow-up question: based on these current figures, what economic advantage does an autotransformer have over a conventional transformer in terms of manufacturing cost?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the pro's and con's of autotransformers over regular transformers.  Of course, there is the obvious disadvantage: loss of isolation between primary and secondary circuits.  If this is not a problem, though, there are substantial advantages to be realized in using an autotransformer over a conventional transformer.
