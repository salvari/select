Choose a power supply voltage and resistance value for $R_1$ that will maintain approximately 15 mA of current through the 1 k$\Omega$ load resistor.  Assume the use of a silicon transistor:

$$\epsfbox{02437x01.eps}$$

To ensure plenty of regulation range (the ability to maintain regulated current over a wide range of load resistance values), design your circuit so that at least 20 volts $V_{CE}$ are dropped across transistor $Q_2$.  Also, calculate the approximate power dissipation of transistor $Q_2$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note that this is just one possible set of values meeting the criteria given for this circuit.  Your own answers may be different!

\vskip 5pt

$R_1$ = 2.287 k$\Omega$ \hskip 30pt $V_{supply}$ = 35 volts \hskip 30pt $P_{Q2} \approx $ 300 mW
