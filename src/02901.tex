Complete the timing diagram, showing the state of the $Q$ output over time as the input switches are actuated.  Assume that $Q$ begins in the low state on power-up:

$$\epsfbox{02901x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02901}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02901x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: complete a schematic diagram showing how this latch circuit could turn a motor on and off through a MOSFET.

$$\epsfbox{02901x03.eps}$$

Also, comment on whether your MOSFET {\it sources} current to the motor or {\it sinks} current from the motor.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may be confused about the width of the last pulse on the $Q$ output.  Remind them that $Q$ follows $D$ for as long as the Enable input is activated!
