In this circuit, the electric motor is supposed to turn on whenever the cadmium sulfide photocell is darkened:

$$\epsfbox{00501x01.eps}$$

Unfortunately, though, the motor refuses to turn on no matter how little light strikes the photocell.  In an attempt to troubleshoot the circuit, a technician measures voltage between the collector and emitter terminals of the transistor with the photocell covered by a piece of dark tape, and measures full battery voltage.  The technician also measures voltage between the collector and base terminals of the transistor, and measures full battery voltage.  At that point, the technician gives up and hands the problem to you.

Based on this information, what do you suspect is faulty in this circuit, and how might you determine the exact location of the fault?  Also, identify what you know to be {\it not} faulted in the circuit, based on the information given here.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The battery, and its connections to the rest of the circuit, are in good condition.  Also, we know that the motor is not failed open.  In all likelihood, the transistor is not being "told" to turn on.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is just as important for your students to be able to identify what is {\it not} faulted in a system as it is for them to be able to identify what is faulted.  Replacing components that are not faulted is expensive and wasteful!

An essential part of answering this question is what the photocell does when light strikes it.  Obviously, it undergoes a change in electrical resistance, but which way?  This is something your students will have to determine before they can successfully troubleshoot the system.  If they do not understand what the system is {\it supposed} to do, they will be helpless in interpreting what it is presently doing.
