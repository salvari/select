Predict how the operation of this logic gate circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03831x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Output of OR gate $U_2$ fails low:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Output of inverter gate $U_3$ fails low:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Output of AND gate $U_1$ fails high:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Output of OR gate $U_2$ fails low: {\it Gate $U_4$ output stuck in the low state.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Output of inverter gate $U_3$ fails low: {\it Gate $U_4$ output stuck in the low state.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Output of AND gate $U_1$ fails high: {\it Gate $U_4$ output simply equal to $\overline{D}$, no other inputs have any effect on $U_4$'s output.}
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
