What will happen to the voltages across resistors R1 and R2 when the load is connected to the divider circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

When the load is connected across R2, R2's voltage will "sag" (decrease) while R1's voltage will rise (increase).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very important concept to be learned about voltage divider circuits: how they respond to applications of load.  Not a single calculation need be done to arrive at the answer for this question, so encourage your students to think {\it qualitatively} rather than {\it quantitatively}.  Too many students have the habit of reaching for their calculators when faced with a problem like this, when they really just need to apply more thought.
