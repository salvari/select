A crystal goblet may be shattered if exposed to high-intensity sound.  Less volume is required to shatter the goblet if the sound is at such a frequency that it {\it resonates} with the goblet's natural frequency.  That is, there will be maximum transfer of energy to the goblet if the sound waves are transmitted at precisely the goblet's resonant frequency.

How does this phenomenon relate to the reception of radio waves, since we know that a radio antenna effectively acts as a resonant LC (inductance/capacitance) network?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A radio antenna will receive electromagnetic energy most efficiently if it is sized (tuned) to the exact frequency of the desired radio waves.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The analogy of a goblet shattered by sound waves helps students readily identify with a concept that is otherwise abstract: the reception of {\it electromagnetic} waves by an antenna.  Ask your students to relate the matching of frequencies to the transmission of radio waves as well as the reception of them.
