%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "blind" via is one that connects a surface layer to an inner layer of a multi-layer PCB.  A "buried" via is one that does not appear on any surface layer at all, but rather goes between inner layers.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One students grasp the concept of a multi-layer board, the necessity of different types of vias will become obvious.  Asking this question, then, is just one more way to communicate the concept of a multi-layer board.
