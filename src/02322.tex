The typical amount of current through a JFET gate terminal is far less than the typical amount of current through a BJT base terminal, for similar controlled currents (drain or collector, respectively).  Explain what it is about the construction and/or use of the JFET that limits the input current to almost nothing during normal operation.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The gate-source PN junction is reverse-biased.

If need be, refer back to a "cut-away" diagram of a JFET to help your students understand why the input impedance of a JFET is what it is.
