Identify each type of MOSFET (whether it is N-channel or P-channel, D-type or E-type), label the terminals, and determine whether the MOSFET in each of these circuits will be turned {\it on} or {\it off}:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is very important for your students to understand what factor(s) in a circuit force a MOSFET to turn on or off.  Some of the information contained in the diagrams is relevant to the determination of each transistor's status, and some is not.

Be sure to ask your students to explain their reasoning for each transistor's status.  What factor, or combination of factors, is necessary to turn a MOSFET on, versus off?
