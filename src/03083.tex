Complete the timing diagram for this universal shift register, given the input conditions shown.  Assume that the parallel load ($\overline{PL}$) input is synchronous, that the shifting direction is from left-to-right (from $Q_0$ to $Q_3$), and that all $Q$ outputs begin in the low state:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{03083x02.eps}$$

Note to instructor: {\it I recommend assigning one-quarter point per output line per clock pulse.  Four output lines and eight clock pulses make for 32 points at which you may check for output states being correct.}
