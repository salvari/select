%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I$ = 141.18 A

$P$ = 90.8 horsepower

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Solving this problem requires unit conversions: from "watts" to "horsepower."  Let your students research how to perform this conversion, then discuss their various techniques during discussion time.

%INDEX% Horsepower, conversion between watts
