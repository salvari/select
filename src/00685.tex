Given the following equations, derive a single equation expressing permeability ($\mu$) in terms of flux density ($B$) and field intensity ($H$, otherwise known as magnetizing force):

$$\Re = {{\cal F} \over \Phi}$$

$$\Re = {l \over \mu A}$$

$$H = {{\cal F} \over l}$$

$$B = {\Phi \over A}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\mu = {B \over H}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is an exercise in algebraic substitution and manipulation.  It might be a good idea to point out that the following equation is valid only for a "solenoid" (a coil of wire).

$$\Re = {l \over \mu A}$$

In the case of an air-core solenoid, the formula is as follows:

$$\Re = {l \over {\mu_0 A}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$l$ = linear length of coil in meters (m)

$A$ = cross-sectional area of coil "throat" in square meters (m$^{2}$)

$\mu_0$ = permeability of free space = $4 \pi$ $\times$ $10^{-7}$ (T$\cdot$m/A)
