An AC voltage source with an internal ("Th\'evenin") resistance of 50 $\Omega$ is connected to a step-down transformer with a winding ratio of 10:1.  What is the equivalent source voltage and resistance, as seen from the load terminals?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Equivalent source voltage = 2.4 VAC; equivalent source resistance = 0.5 $\Omega$.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how they obtained the equivalent voltage and current figures for this transformer-coupled source.  Is there a scenario we could imagine the source being placed in that would allow us to obtain these figures without knowing anything about transformer impedance matching?
