Examine the following transistor symbol:

$$\epsfbox{02331x01.eps}$$

\goodbreak

Identify the following:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Type of transistor ({\it BJT, JFET, or MOSFET})
\item{$\bullet$} Semiconductor doping ({\it NPN, PNP ; N-channel, P-channel})
\item{$\bullet$} Identification of all 3 terminals ({\it Base, Collector, Emitter ; Gate, Drain, Source})
\item{$\bullet$} Direction of each terminal's current for proper transistor operation ({\it be sure to note whether you are using conventional flow or electron flow notation.  If current direction is unimportant, or if there is no current at all, be sure to say so!})

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question probes some basic yet important knowledge about transistor identify and operation.  If students have difficulty identifying all the parameters asked for in this question, you need to spend more time on transistor fundamentals before proceeding with any other aspects of transistor circuitry!
