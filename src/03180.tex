{\it Cutoff} voltage is not the same thing as {\it pinch-off} voltage, although the names seem quite similar.  Give a concise definition for each of these field-effect transistor parameters, referencing them to a graph of characteristic curves if possible.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it Cutoff} voltage is that gate-to-source voltage ($V_{GS}$) resulting in zero drain current.  {\it Pinch-off} voltage is that drain-to-source voltage ($V_{DS}$) value where further increases do not yield significantly greater drain current values.

Follow-up question: which of these two parameters is more appropriate to consider when using an FET as a switch, and which is more appropriate when using an FET as a linear amplifier?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This contrast and comparison is probably best shown on a graph of characteristic curves, but I leave this to the student to research!
