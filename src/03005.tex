{\it Multiplexers} and {\it demultiplexers} are often confused with one another by students first learning about them.  Although they appear similar, they certainly perform different functions.  Shown here is a multiplexer and a demultiplexer, each using a multiple-position switch symbol to indicate the selection functions inside the respective circuits:

$$\epsfbox{03005x02.eps}$$

After identifying which is which, provide definitions for "multiplexer" and "demultiplexer" in your own words.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question forces students to directly face a point of confusion I have noticed over several years of teaching.  Ask them where they were able to find definitions for each term.

%INDEX% Multiplexer, defined
%INDEX% Demultiplexer, defined
