%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Electrical {\it resistance} is not hazardous in the least.  In fact, the more resistance there is, the less chance there is for electrons to flow, thus minimizing shock hazard.

A joke it may be, but still a fun one to play.  Hang a large sign saying "Danger: high resistance" over the entrance to the electrical lab and watch the responses of the uninitiated!
