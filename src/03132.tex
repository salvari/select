Explain what a {\it time-delay relay} is, and how it functionally differs from a regular electromechanical relay.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "time-delay" relay either waits before actuating after power-up, or waits before de-actuating after power-down.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The earliest time-delay relays used pneumatic "dash-pot" motion dampers to provide the necessary actuation or de-actuation delays.  Modern time-delay relays use electronic timer circuits to do the time delay function, even when the output of the relay is still a set of mechanical contacts.
