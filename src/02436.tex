Explain how the characteristic curve of a 24 volt zener diode (as plotted by a curve tracer) differs from that of a normal rectifying diode, shown here:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to cause students to think about what a characteristic curve means, in the context of diode comparisons.  The breakdown voltage of a zener diode is typically so low compared to that of a normal rectifying diode that this region may be easily shown on the curve tracer screen.
