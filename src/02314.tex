Trace the current through this rectifier circuit at a moment in time when the AC source's polarity is positive on left and negative on right as shown.  Be sure to designate the convention you use for current direction (conventional or electron flow):

$$\epsfbox{02314x01.eps}$$

Also, mark the polarity of the voltage drop across $R_{load}$.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students explain their reasoning when tracing currents and determining voltage drop polarities in front of the class for all too see.  The bridge rectifier circuit is one that many students find confusing to analyze, and so it is worth spending time on in class to fully understand.
