Calculate the total impedance of these parallel-connected components, expressing it in polar form (magnitude and phase angle):

$$\epsfbox{02108x01.eps}$$

Also, draw an admittance triangle for this circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Z_{total}$ = 391.4 $\Omega$ $\angle$ -39.9$^{o}$

$$\epsfbox{02108x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may wonder why every side of the triangle is represented by a $Y$ term, rather than $Y$ for the hypotenuse, $G$ for the adjacent, and $B$ for the opposite.  If students ask about this, remind them that conductance ($G$) and susceptance ($B$) are simple two different {\it types} of admittances ($Y$), just as resistance ($R$) and reactance ($X$) are simply two different types of impedances ($Z$).
