Suppose a GFCI is rated to "trip" with a ground fault current of 5 mA.  Given a source voltage of 115 volts, calculate the ground fault resistance range required to trip.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Any resistance value between 0 $\Omega$ to 23 k$\Omega$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question requires the use of Ohm's Law, but to calculate a {\it range} of resistance values and not just a singular value.  All students should be able to obtain the figure of 23 k$\Omega$, but some may be confused as to whether this is a minimum or a maximum resistance value needed to trip the GFCI.  Discuss this with your students, asking them to explain how we know 23 k$\Omega$ is a maximum figure and not a minimum figure.
