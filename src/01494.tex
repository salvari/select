With the headphones connected to the input of your audio detector circuit, what is the {\it lowest} current level of signal you can hear, as measured with a sensitive milliammeter connected in series between your detector and a signal source?

$$\epsfbox{01494x01.eps}$$

Compare this against the lowest amount of audible signal current for the headphones directly.  Which component of the detector circuit is responsible for this increased sensitivity?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The transformer.  But, can you explain {\it why?}

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very practical way for students to experience the significance of impedance matching using transformers.
