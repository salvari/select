Two methods of biasing push-pull transistor pairs are shown here:

$$\epsfbox{00973x01.eps}$$

Which of these two methods is preferred, and why?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Biasing with diodes is preferred, because the bias voltage remains stable despite fluctuations in power supply rail voltages.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what is special about a {\it diode} that provides just the right amount of bias voltage for the transistors.
