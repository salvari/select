If a sinusoidal voltage is applied to an impedance with a phase angle of 0$^{o}$, the resulting voltage and current waveforms will look like this:

$$\epsfbox{00631x01.eps}$$

Given that power is the product of voltage and current ($p = i e$), plot the waveform for power in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to observe the waveform shown in the answer closely, and determine what {\it sign} the power values always are.  Note how the voltage and current waveforms alternate between positive and negative, but power does not.  Of what significance is this to us?  What does this indicate about the nature of a load with an impedance phase angle of 0$^{o}$?
