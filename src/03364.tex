Resistors are often used to drop excessive voltage so that low-voltage devices may successfully operate from the power provided by high(er)-voltage sources.  For example, this 100 ohm resistor limits current to the lamp so it does not burn out when supplied by the battery:

$$\epsfbox{03364x01.eps}$$

The resistance of the lamp when glowing (carrying its normal rated current of 59 mA) is 280 ohms.  Calculate the necessary voltage of the battery to power this circuit at that current level, and also calculate the minimum necessary power rating of the 100 ohm resistor (choose from 1/8 watt, 1/4 watt, 1/2 watt, 1 watt, or 2 watt).
