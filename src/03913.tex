This "flash" ADC circuit has a problem.  The output code jumps from {\tt 0000} to {\tt 1111} with just the slightest amount of input voltage ($V_{in}$).  In fact, the only time it outputs {\tt 0000} is when the input terminal is slightly negative with reference to ground:

Identify at least two possible component faults that could cause this problem, and explain your reasoning in how you made the identifications.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

One possible fault is that resistor $R_{16}$ has failed open, but this is not the only possibility.

Have your students explain their reasoning in class to you, so that you may observe their diagnostic thought processes.
