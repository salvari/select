Solve for values of $x$ and $y$ that will satisfy both of the following equations at the same time:

$$x + 2y = 9$$

$$4x - y = -18$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$x = -3$ \hskip 30pt $y = 6$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: solve this system of simultaneous equations using both substitution (solving for one variable in one of the equations and substituting that into the other equation) and addition (adding the two equations together to produce a third equation with only one unknown).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing special here -- just practice solving for a two-variable system of equations.
