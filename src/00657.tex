Suppose you were to take a 3 kW electric heater rated for 240 VAC and connect it to a 120 VAC power source.  How much power would it dissipate when connected to a voltage source equal to {\it half} its rating?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P =$ 750 W

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A common mistake students make is to think that applying half the normal amount of voltage to a resistor results in half the power dissipation.  This is not correct.  There are many ways to disprove the assertion mathematically, and I won't bother to list my favorite here.  Discuss this with your students, and see what {\it their} reasoning is.
