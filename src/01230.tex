Add the following eight-bit two's complement numbers together, and then convert all binary quantities into decimal form to verify the accuracy of the addition:

\vskip 10pt

$$\epsfbox{01230x01.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

\underbar{file 01230}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01230x02.eps}$$

Follow-up question: Why are some of these answers incorrect?  Hint: perform the additions in {\it decimal} form rather than binary form, and then explain why those answers are not represented in the binary answers.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question introduces students to the phenomenon of {\it overflow}.  This is a very important principle to understand, because real computer systems must deal with this condition properly, so as not to output incorrect answers!
