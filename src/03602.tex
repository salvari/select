Explain how the Superposition Theorem may be used to analyze the voltage and current values in this circuit:

You do not have to go into great detail with your explanation.  I am only looking for a general description of what the Superposition Theorem is, which you can probably explain in two sentences or less.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

When we apply the Superposition Theorem, we consider each power source one at a time, replacing all other power sources with their respective internal resistances.  Then, we take all the voltage and current values calculated for the components under these single-source conditions and sum them up, yielding the voltage and current values when all sources are in effect.
