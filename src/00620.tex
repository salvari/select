%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some of these filter designs are resonant in nature, while others are not.  Resonant circuits, especially when made with high-Q components, approach ideal band-pass (or -block) characteristics.  Discuss with your students the different design strategies between resonant and non-resonant band filters.  

Although resonant band filter designs have nearly ideal (theoretical) characteristics, band filters built with capacitors and resistors only are also popular.  Ask your students why this might be.  Is there any reason inductors might purposefully be avoided when designing filter circuits?
