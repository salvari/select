In this AC circuit, the resistor offers 300 $\Omega$ of resistance, and the inductor offers 400 $\Omega$ of reactance.  Together, their series opposition to alternating current results in a current of 10 mA from the 5 volt source:

$$\epsfbox{00584x01.eps}$$

How many ohms of opposition does the series combination of resistor and inductor offer?  What name do we give to this quantity, and how do we symbolize it, being that it is composed of both resistance ($R$) and reactance ($X$)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Z_{total} =$ 500 $\Omega$.

Follow-up question: suppose that the inductor suffers a failure in its wire winding, causing it to "open."  Explain what effect this would have on circuit current and voltage drops.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students may experience difficulty arriving at the same quantity for impedance shown in the answer.  If this is the case, help them problem-solve by suggesting they {\bf simplify the problem}: short past one of the load components and calculate the new circuit current.  Soon they will understand the relationship between total circuit opposition and total circuit current, and be able to apply this concept to the original problem.

Ask your students why the quantities of 300 $\Omega$ and 400 $\Omega$ do not add up to 700 $\Omega$ like they would if they were both resistors.  Does this scenario remind them of another mathematical problem where $3 + 4 = 5$?  Where have we seen this before, especially in the context of electric circuits?

Once your students make the cognitive connection to trigonometry, ask them the significance of these numbers' addition.  Is it enough that we say a component has an opposition to AC of 400 $\Omega$, or is there more to this quantity than a single, scalar value?  What type of number would be suitable for representing such a quantity, and how might it be written?
