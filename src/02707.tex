The equation for voltage gain ($A_V$) in a typical noninverting, single-ended opamp circuit is as follows:

$$A_V = {R_{1} \over R_{2}} + 1$$

\noindent
Where,

$R_1$ is the feedback resistor (connecting the output to the inverting input)

$R_2$ is the other resistor (connecting the inverting input to ground)

Suppose we wished to change the voltage gain in the following circuit from 5 to 6.8, but only had the freedom to alter the resistance of $R_{2}$:

$$\epsfbox{02707x01.eps}$$

Algebraically manipulate the gain equation to solve for $R_2$, then determine the necessary value of $R_2$ in this circuit to give it a voltage gain of 6.8.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$R_2 = {R_1 \over {A_V - 1}}$$

\vskip 10pt

For the circuit shown, $R_2$ would have to be set equal to 810.3 $\Omega$.
