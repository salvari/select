%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I strongly recommend having students build their logic circuits with CMOS chips rather than TTL, because of the less stringent power supply requirements of CMOS.  I also recommend drawing a combinational circuit using four gates, because this is the common number of two-input gates found on 14-pin DIP logic chips.
