When inserting a signal coupling capacitor into the bias network for this transistor amplifier, which way should the (polarized) capacitor go?  (Hint: the AC signal source outputs pure AC, with a time-averaged DC value of 0 volts).

Explain why the orientation of this capacitor matters, and what might happen if it is connected the wrong way.

It is easy to miss the detail of the power supply's polarity being "backward" from what is typically seen (negative instead of positive).  Actually, I am surprised to see how many introductory textbooks have the coupling capacitor drawn the wrong way, so expect that some students may become confused by researching their texts for the answer!
