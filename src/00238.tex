I'm not sure if there is a specific code or regulation governing the number of terminals connected to a terminal block, but the "no more than two wires per lug" rule makes good sense.  That is, of course, unless two conductors stuffed in the same hole would exceed the maximum cross-sectional area limit of the block, then "no more than one wire" is the rule.

I have had the misfortune of seeing egregious violations of both rules in my work experience!
