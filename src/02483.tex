%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Class-A" amplifier operation means that the final (power) transistor duplicates the entire waveshape of the input signal, and not just a part of it.

Of course, the natural question following this one is, "What other classes of operation are there?"  This would be an excellent time to preview Class-B (push-pull) and Class-C operations if time permits.
