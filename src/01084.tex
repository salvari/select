Follow-up question: does the resonant frequency of the tank circuit have to match the crystal's resonant frequency?  Why or why not?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain what purpose a crystal serves in an oscillator circuit that already contains a tank circuit for tuning.
