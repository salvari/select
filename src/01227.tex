Two's complement notation really shows its value in binary addition, where positive and negative quantities may be handled with equal ease.  Add the following byte-long (8 bit) two's complement numbers together, and then convert all binary quantities into decimal form to verify the accuracy of the addition:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students do some of these problems on the board, in front of class for all to see.  Ask students what happens to the left-most "carry" bit, if it exists in any of these problems.  Ask them {\it why} we do what we do with that bit, when we would usually place it in our answer.
