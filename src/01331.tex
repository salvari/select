An important parameter of high-reliability systems is abbreviated {\it MTBF}.  What does this acronym stand for?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"MTBF" = {\it Mean Time Between Failures}, a statistical figure based on the failure rate of a large batch of continuously operating units.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is important for students to realize that an MTBF figure is not to be taken as the amount of time an average component is expected to last.  For example, an integrated circuit with an MTBF of 1.5 million hours should not actually be expected to last 1.5 million continuous hours.  Its real life will most likely be less than that!
