This astable multivibrator circuit will oscillate with a 50\% duty cycle if the components are symmetrically sized:

$$\epsfbox{02254x01.eps}$$

Determine which component(s) would have to be re-sized to produce a duty cycle other than 50\%.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I won't answer this question directly, but I will give a large hint: $C_1$ and $R_2$ determine the pulse width of one-half of the square wave, while $C_2$ and $R_3$ control the pulse width of the other half:

$$\epsfbox{02254x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: re-draw the schematic diagram to show how a potentiometer could be used to make the duty cycle adjustable over a wide range.
