Predict how the operation of this solar panel tracking circuit (where the tracking motor turns in response to a difference in light sensed by the two photoresistors) will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Assuming that the motor spins clockwise when its left terminal is negative and its right terminal is positive (when $Q_2$ and $Q_3$ are both on), specify the direction of rotation (or non-rotation) resulting from each fault.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
