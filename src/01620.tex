%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that the input states in this circuit are defined by the voltage levels, not by the contact status.  In other words, a closed contact equals a "low" (0) logic state.

I strongly recommend having students build their logic circuits with CMOS chips rather than TTL, because of the less stringent power supply requirements of CMOS.  I also recommend drawing a combinational circuit using four gates, because this is the common number of two-input gates found on 14-pin DIP logic chips.
