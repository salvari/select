%(BEGIN_NOTES)

You should discuss with your students the fact that IGBT's are not actually made of two discrete transistors connected as shown.  Instead, they are fabricated as monolithic devices, all on the same semiconductor substrate.  The "model" of an IGBT consisting of a MOSFET coupled to a BJT is similar to the model commonly used to emulate an SCR: a circuit whose sole purpose it is to show the operation of a special device in terms of other, well-understood devices.
