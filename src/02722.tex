Suppose you need to build an inverting amplifier circuit to take a weak signal from an 8 $\Omega$ microphone and amplify the voltage by a factor of 25.  Choose the resistor values that will most efficiently accomplish this task (hint: we need to transfer the maximum power possible from the microphone to the amplifier).
