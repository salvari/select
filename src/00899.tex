The nonconducting depletion region of a PN junction forms a parasitic capacitance between the P and the N semiconductor region.  Does the capacitance increase or decrease as a greater reverse-bias voltage is applied to the PN junction?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The junction capacitance will decrease as the reverse-bias voltage across the junction increases.

Challenge question: can you think of any practical applications for this variable-capacitance effect?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is a good review of capacitor theory, and also an opportunity to introduce a special kind of diode: the {\it varactor}.
