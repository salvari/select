The equation solving for drain current through a JFET is as follows:

$$I_D = I_{DSS}\Bigl(1 - {V_{GS} \over V_{GS(off)}}\Bigr)^2$$

\noindent
Where,

$I_D$ = Drain current

$I_{DSS}$ = Drain current with the Gate terminal shorted to the Source terminal

$V_{GS}$ = Applied Gate-to-Source voltage

$V_{GS(off)}$ = Gate-to-Source voltage necessary to "cut off" the JFET

\vskip 10pt

Algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for $V_{GS}$, and explain why this new equation might be useful to us.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$V_{GS} = V_{GS(off)}\Biggl( 1 - \sqrt{I_D \over I_{DSS}} \Biggr)$$
