A series AC circuit exhibits a total impedance of 5.3 k$\Omega$, with a phase shift of 57 degrees between voltage and current.  Drawn in an impedance triangle, it looks like this:

$$\epsfbox{03190x01.eps}$$

Use the appropriate trigonometric functions to calculate the equivalent values of $R$ and $X$ in this series circuit.
