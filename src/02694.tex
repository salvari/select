How much current will go through the load in this op-amp circuit?

$$\epsfbox{02694x01.eps}$$

What impact will a change in load resistance have on the operation of this circuit?  What will change, if anything, supposing the load resistance were to increase?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{load} =$ 1.818 mA

\vskip 10pt

If the load changes resistance, there will be no effect on the amount of current through it, although there will be an effect on the output {\it voltage} of the opamp!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question, besides giving students reason to review a constant-current opamp circuit, is to preview the behavior of an active integrator using the same resistor and input voltage values (question \#01008).
