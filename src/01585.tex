Examine the following "component" stereo system closely:

$$\epsfbox{01585x01.eps}$$

The CD player generates the audio signal to be amplified, while the equalizer/preamp modifies the tone of the signal to suit the listener's preferences and the power amplifier provides adequate power to drive the speakers.

Suppose this system has a problem: no sound at all coming out of either speaker.  All components in the system are turned on, as indicated by power lights on the front panels.  All control knobs seem to be set to their proper positions, as well.  The CD player indicates the disk is being played, and that it is presently playing a song.  Despite all these good indicators, though, no sound is heard from the speakers.

Being prepared at all times to troubleshoot electronic systems, you have a digital multimeter close by which you may use to check for the presence of audio signals (set the meter to measure AC millivolts).  All audio signal cables (including the speaker cables) may be unplugged to provide access for your meter's test probes.

At what point in the system would you begin testing for the presence of an audio signal?  Explain why you chose that point, and describe your subsequent actions based on the results of that test.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

My personal preference would be to unplug the output cables from the equalizer/preamp unit and test for signal output there.  I'll leave the other steps up to you, to elaborate on in class discussion with your peers!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students how this is an ideal application for the "divide-and-conquer" strategy of troubleshooting, where you divide the signal path into halves, checking for the presence of a signal at each half-way point, narrowing in on the location of the faulted component in a rapid manner.
