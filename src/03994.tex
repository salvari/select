Radio-controlled toy cars, airplanes, and boats use small servo motors for positioning of the steering mechanisms, engine throttle position, and such.  These servos have the motor, position sensor, and control electronics housed in the same plastic package, making them very compact.

Research the type(s) of control signals used to command these servo units.  In other words, find out what sort of electronic signal they require to "command" them to go to certain positions.  Then, suggest a circuit that could generate these signals.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I will not give an answer here, not just because I want you to do all the research and thinking for yourself, but also because RC servo technology may have changed changed since I wrote this question!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The availability of inexpensive RC servos makes them ideal for use in lab experiments and student projects.  It is well worth your students' time (and yours!) to find out how these amazing little devices are controlled!
