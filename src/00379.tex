Calculate the total inductance in this collection of inductors, as measured between the two wires:

$$\epsfbox{00379x01.eps}$$

Also, write a formula that calculates total inductance given the values of inductors $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$.

\underbar{file 00379}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$L_{total}$ = 783.26 mH

\vskip 10pt

Note: the following formula is not the only possible one for describing total inductance in this circuit!

$$L_{total} = L_1 + {{L_2 L_3} \over {L_2 + L_3}}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is most helpful to first draw a schematic diagram for this inductor network before trying to perform any inductance calculations, in order that a clear understanding of the series/parallel connections be established.
