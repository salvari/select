The decay of a variable (either voltage or current) in a time-constant circuit (RC or LR) follows this mathematical expression:

$$e^{-{t \over \tau}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$e =$ Euler's constant ($\approx 2.718281828$)

$t =$ Time, in seconds

$\tau =$ Time constant of circuit, in seconds

\vskip 10pt

Calculate the value of this expression as $t$ increases, given a circuit time constant ($\tau$) of 1 second.  Express this value as a {\it percentage}:

\medskip
\item{} $t =$ 1 second
\item{} $t =$ 2 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 3 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 4 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 5 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 6 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 7 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 8 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 9 seconds
\item{} $t =$ 10 seconds
\medskip

Based on your calculations, how would you describe the change in the expression's value over time as $t$ increases?

\medskip
\item{} $t =$ 1 second ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 36.788\%
\item{} $t =$ 2 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 13.534\%
\item{} $t =$ 3 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 4.979\%
\item{} $t =$ 4 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 1.832\%
\item{} $t =$ 5 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 0.6738\%
\item{} $t =$ 6 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 0.2479\%
\item{} $t =$ 7 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 0.09119\%
\item{} $t =$ 8 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 0.03355\%
\item{} $t =$ 9 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 0.01234\%
\item{} $t =$ 10 seconds ; $e^{-{t \over \tau}} =$ 0.004540\%

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is for students to learn the significance of the expression $e^{-{t \over \tau}}$ by "playing" with the numbers.  The negative exponent may confuse some students, so be sure to discuss its significance with all students, so that all understand what it means.

Another concept for students to grasp in this question is that of an {\it asymptotic} function: a function that approaches a final value in incrementally smaller intervals.
