How is pulse-width modulation power control similar to the form of control exerted by TRIACs and SCRs in AC power circuits?  How does it differ?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

As in PWM, AC power control circuits using TRIAC and SCR devices modulate power by controlling the amount of {\it time} the load receives power from the source.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the similarities and differences between these two forms of time-based power control.  Of course, PWM is more sophisticated than naturally-commutated SCR and TRIAC control schemes, but it is also more complex and therefore possibly more prone to faults.
