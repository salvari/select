Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts.  Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k$\Omega$ and 100 k$\Omega$ (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).  Use a sine-wave function generator to supply an audio-frequency input signal, about 0.5 volts AC (peak).

Resistor values I have found practical are 10 k$\Omega$ for $R_C$ and 2.2 k$\Omega$ for $R_E$.  This gives a voltage gain of 4.545, and quiescent current values that are well within the range of common small-signal transistors.

An important aspect of this performance assessment is that students know what to do with the potentiometer.  It is their responsibility to configure the circuit so that it operates in Class-A mode, and to explain the importance of proper biasing.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
