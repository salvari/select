From the "diode check" measurements taken with these two meters, identify the terminals on this JFET, and also what type of JFET it is (N-channel or P-channel):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The left-most terminal on this JFET is the gate, and the other two are source and drain.  This is a P-channel JFET.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain why the gate-channel junction registers a voltage drop of 0.743 volts, while the source-drain path only registers 15 millivolts of drop.  What does this indicate about the conductivity of  JFET compared to that of a BJT?  Also, what does this suggest about the minimum source-drain voltage necessary for controlled current to go through the JFET?
