Calculate the current through a 250 mH inductor after "charging" through a series-connected resistor with 100 $\Omega$ of resistance for 6 milliseconds, powered by a 12 volt battery.  Assume that the inductor is perfect, with no internal resistance.

Also, express this amount of time (6 milliseconds) in terms of how many {\it time constants} have elapsed.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_L =$ 109.11 mA @ $t =$ 6 milliseconds

\vskip 10pt

6 ms = 2.4 time constants ($2.4\tau$)

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, students must choose which equation to use for the calculation, calculate the time constant for the circuit, and put all the variables in the right place to obtain the correct answer.  Discuss all these steps with your students, allowing them to explain how they approached the question.
