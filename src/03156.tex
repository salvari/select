Suppose we wished to use the first seven bits of each port (pins 0 through 6) on a microcontroller to drive two 7-segment, common-cathode displays, rather than use BCD-to-7-segment decoder ICs:

$$\epsfbox{03156x01.eps}$$

Write the necessary hexadecimal values to be output at ports A and B to generate the display "28" at the two 7-segment display units.

\underbar{file 03156}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Port A = 7F$_{16}$ \hskip 50pt Port B = 5B$_{16}$

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
Note that the following answers are also valid:

Port A = FF$_{16}$ \hskip 50pt Port B = DB$_{16}$
