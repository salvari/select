Examine this push-pull audio amplifier circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01126x01.eps}$$

Answer the following questions about this circuit based on your analysis of it:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} How is phase splitting accomplished in this circuit? 
\item{$\bullet$} What is the purpose of resistor $R_1$? 
\item{$\bullet$} What would happen if resistor $R_1$ failed open?
\item{$\bullet$} What would happen if the wire connecting the base of transistor $Q_2$ to the input transformer ($T_1$) were to fail open?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} The input transformer $T_1$ provides phase splitting. 
\item{$\bullet$} $R_1$ establishes the Q point of both transistors.
\item{$\bullet$} If $R_1$ failed open, both transistors would go into cutoff mode.
\item{$\bullet$} If the wire connecting the base of transistor $Q_2$ to the input transformer ($T_1$) were to fail open, one-half of the output waveform would become clipped.
