Explain what a {\it universal} shift register is.  The 74194 is an example of a TTL universal shift register, so you will find that datasheet very helpful in answering this question.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A {\it universal} shift register has the ability to input data in either serial or parallel form, as well as output data in either serial or parallel form.

Note: this answer is purposely minimal.  I expect you to provide a more detailed answer during discussion, based on research of universal shift registers!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Regarding the point in the answer about student research, ask your students how a single shift register chip is able to perform all the different types of input/output combinations.  Ask your students, for instance, how to make the 74194 act {\it only} as a parallel-in/parallel-out register.
