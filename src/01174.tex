Suppose that diode D1 in this precision rectifier circuit fails open.  What effect will this have on the output voltage?

$$\epsfbox{01174x01.eps}$$

Hint: if it helps, draw a table of figures relating $V_{in}$ with $V_{out}$, and base your answer on the tabulated results.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Instead of the output voltage remaining at exactly 0 volts for any positive input voltage, the output will be equal to the (positive) input voltage, assuming it remains unloaded as shown.

Challenge question: what mathematical function does this circuit perform, with diode D1 failed open?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note that the given failure does not render the circuit useless, but transforms its function into something different!  This is an important lesson for students to understand: that component failures may not always results in complete circuit non-function.  The circuit may continue to function, just differently.  And, in some cases such as this, the new function may even appear to be intentional!
