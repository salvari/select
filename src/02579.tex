The following circuit is called a {\it twin-tee} filter:

$$\epsfbox{02579x01.eps}$$

Research the equation predicting this circuit's "notch" frequency, given the component value ratios shown.

$$f_{notch} = \hbox{\hskip 20pt}$$

\underbar{file 02579}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$f_{notch} = {1 \over {2 \pi R C}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Answering this question is simply a matter of research!  There are many references a student could go to for information on twin-tee filters.
