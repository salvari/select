A capacitor has a label on it saying, "100 WVDC".  What does this label mean?  What is the consequence of exceeding this rating?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The capacitor's {\it working voltage} is 100 volts DC.  Failure of the dielectric material will result from exceeding this voltage rating.  In electrolytic capacitors especially, the failure can be violent!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

As with resistors and resistance ratings, there is more to the rating of a capacitor than merely capacitance!  Discuss with your students the importance of safety when working with capacitors, not only from shock hazard but also from explosions (resulting from excessive voltage).
