{\it Stepper motors} are often used in low-power servomechanisms such as those found in small robots, computer printers, and other precision electro-mechanical machines.  Explain why this type of electric motor is more popular than permanent-magnet DC motors or other motor types.  Hint: the answer is closely related to the name of the motor itself ("stepper").

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Unlike other motor types, {\it stepper} motors move in discrete "steps," lending themselves very well to digital modes of position control.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Make sure students get a chance to feel the motion of a stepper motor in their own hands when you discuss stepper motors in class.  If you don't happen to have any stepper motors available, they are easily obtained by salvaging parts from worn-out computer printers!
