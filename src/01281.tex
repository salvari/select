What does it mean if you see a logic gate symbol in a schematic diagram with a strange-looking "S" figure drawn inside of it?

$$\epsfbox{01281x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The "S" figure, which resembles a magnetic B-H hysteresis curve, marks this gate as a {\it Schmitt trigger}.  I'll let you do the research to determine what this means in regard to gate function.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Schmitt trigger gates are indispensable for certain logic circuit applications.  It is important that students recognize their function and utility.

Incidentally, this question provides a good opportunity to review magnetic hysteresis curves, since it's probably been awhile since students last studied electromagnetism theory!
