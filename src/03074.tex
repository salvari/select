Complete the timing diagram for this three-bit counter circuit, and also determine whether it counts {\it up} or {\it down}.  Assume that all $Q$ outputs begin in the low state:

$$\epsfbox{03074x01.eps}$$

Counting {\it up} or {\it down}?

\underbar{file 03074}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This counter circuit counts in the {\bf up} direction:

$$\epsfbox{03074x02.eps}$$

Note to instructor: {\it I recommend assigning two points to each correct $Q$ output waveform, and another two points to the direction of count.}
