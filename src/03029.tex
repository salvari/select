Complete the schematic diagram, showing how two momentary-contact pushbutton switches ("Start" and "Stop"), complete with any necessary pullup or pulldown resistors, could be connected to the inputs of this S-R latch to control a DC electric motor:

$$\epsfbox{03029x01.eps}$$

Note that the Reset input is active-low, while the Set input is active-high, and also that the transistor is controlled by the $\overline{Q}$ output.  Don't forget to label which pushbutton switch is "Start" and which is "Stop"!
