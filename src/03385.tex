One of the resistors in this voltage divider circuit has failed (either open or shorted).  Based on the voltage readings shown at each load, comparing what each load voltage is versus what it should be, determine which resistor has failed and what type of failure it is:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Resistor $R_3$ has failed shorted.

Use this question as an opportunity to discuss troubleshooting strategies with your students.  A helpful hint in dealing with this kind of problem is to categorize each load voltage as either being {\it greater} or {\it less} than normal.  Forget the negative signs here: we're dealing strictly with absolute values (in other words, -25 volts is a "greater" voltage than -20 volts).  Once each load voltage has been categorized thusly, it is possible to isolate the location and nature of the fault without having to deal with numbers at all!
