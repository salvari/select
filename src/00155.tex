%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Most people think the answer to this question is {\it gold}.  However, there is another type of metal that conducts electricity better than any other type of metal, including gold!  Document where you found your answer to this question.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A few of your students may come across {\it superconductors} in their research, which of course conduct electricity perfectly (with no resistance to electric current whatsoever).  However, the answer I'm looking for here is the non-superconducting metal with the lowest electrical resistance of all.
