Design a circuit that adds two binary bits together.  This circuit will have two inputs ($A$ and $B$) and two outputs (Sum and Carry):

$$\epsfbox{01478x01.eps}$$

Begin the design process by drawing a truth table for the circuit, then determining the necessary gate circuitry to fulfill each output function.

\vskip 10pt

Why is this circuit referred to as a {\it half adder}?  How would a {\it full} adder circuit differ from this?

Have your students explain their design process to you, step by step.  This circuit diagram is easy enough to discover in the pages of a textbook, so don't be surprised if students simply copy what they see without trying to understand how it works!
