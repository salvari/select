The best regulator designs use {\it feedback} to ensure "tight" regulation of voltage over a wide range of load currents.  Explain what this "feedback" is, and how it works to improve voltage regulation.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

With "feedback," the output voltage is sampled and "fed back" to a prior stage in the transistor circuit, so that any load-induced change in output voltage elicits a response from the amplifier to counter-act that change.  In other words, feedback makes the circuit "aware" of its own output.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Many voltage regulator circuits employ operational amplifiers (using negative feedback) to accomplish this very design goal: improved voltage regulation.  Your students may find a perusal of an op-amp based design helpful when considering how to build their regulator circuits out of discrete components.
