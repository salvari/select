Identify the function of this active filter:

$$\epsfbox{00708x01.eps}$$

It is low pass, high pass, band pass, or band stop?  Explain your answer.

\underbar{file 00708}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a band pass filter circuit.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students their methods of determining filter type.  How did they approach this problem, to see what type of filter this circuit was?  Determining the identify of a "band-" filter is more difficult than with a low- or a high- pass filter circuit, because the behavior is roughly the same at both extremes of the frequency range.
