Your project is to research the schematic diagram and component values for an audio tone control circuit (bass and treble controls), then build one in a nice enclosure.  There are plenty of resources on the internet for you to research, as well as many good textbooks on audio circuitry for you to read.  If you are a musician, you may want to consider building a tone control for your electric instrument (electric guitar, electric violin or viola, etc.).  If you like to listen to portable music devices, you may want to consider building a stereo tone control (using double-ganged potentiometers so both channels have the same tone) for your portable music player.
