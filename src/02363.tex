%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The "normal" status of a switch refers to the open or closed status of the contacts when there is no actuating force applied to the switch.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

An important qualification for an electrical switch to be either "normally-open" or "normally-closed" is that it have a spring to return it to its "normal" state in the absence of an actuating force.  Latching switches such as most toggle switches really cannot be defined in terms of "normally-" anything.  Discuss this with your students, possibly showing them some examples of momentary contact switches that {\it are} either N.O. or N.C.
