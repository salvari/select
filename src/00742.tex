A very common design of AC motor is the so-called {\it squirrel cage} motor.  Describe how a "squirrel cage" motor is built, and classify it as either an "induction" motor or a "synchronous" motor.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There is a lot of information on "squirrel cage" electric motors.  I will leave it to you to do the research.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although it is easy enough for students to find information on squirrel cage motors classifying them as either induction or synchronous, you should challenge your students to {\it explain} why it is one type or the other.  The goal here, as always, is {\it comprehension} over {\it memorization}.
