%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that the input states in this circuit are defined by the voltage levels, not by the contact status.  In other words, a closed contact equals a "low" (0) logic state.

Here, the arrangement of the input letters D, C, B, and A is purposeful: D represents the most significant bit, while A represents the least significant bit, just like the IC datasheets typically order the input lines.

Normally, I draw LEDs in the schematic to give visual indication of output states.  Here, due to the sheer number of required LEDs (16), I decided not to.  However, students with access to lots of LEDs may choose to add them to their circuits, because visual indicators do make the circuit's function easier to understand.

If the decoder IC has enable inputs, the students must figure out what to do with them to make the circuit function!
