Suppose an engineer designed a fire alarm system for a large warehouse, with multiple pushbutton switches connected to a single alarm siren:

$$\epsfbox{00285x01.eps}$$

Actuating any of the normally-open switches results in the alarm sounding.  So far, so good.

Now, suppose that one of the wires connecting one side of several switches to the rest of the circuit breaks open.  What will the result of this failure be?

$$\epsfbox{00285x02.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The result of this wiring failure will be that the lower four switches will be non-functional.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The immediate and obvious conclusion is that four out of the five switches will be non-functional.  However, it isn't this consequence in itself that is the greatest problem.  Rather, it is the {\it silence} of the failure -- no one knows anything has failed, until they try to use one of the non-functional switches!  Ask your students to explain what the essential nature of the problem is: what is it about this circuit's operation that makes an "open" failure in the field wiring so dangerously inconspicuous?
