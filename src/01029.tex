%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The energy of photons (light "particles") striking a PN semiconductor junction creates electron-hole pairs, which then move in the direction that the depletion region's electric field pushes them.

There is quite a bit of detail that could be added to the account given in the answer.  Ask your students to supply some of this detail!  There are many resources for learning how photovoltaic cells work, so your students should have no trouble finding the information on their own.
