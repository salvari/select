One of the "rules" we apply to operational amplifier circuits regards the input currents:

$$\epsfbox{02714x01.eps}$$

Explain what this rule is.  How much input current do we typically have through each input terminal of an operational amplifier?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{input}$ = 0 mA

\vskip 10pt

Actually, we {\it do} have a very small input current on each terminal, but it is usually so small that we can safely ignore it in most calculations.
