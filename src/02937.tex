Locate a manufacturer's datasheet for a flip-flop IC, and research the following parameters:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Flip-flop type (S-R, D, J-K)
\item{$\bullet$} Part number
\item{$\bullet$} ANSI/IEEE standard symbol
\item{$\bullet$} How many asynchronous inputs
\item{$\bullet$} Minimum setup and hold times (shown in timing diagrams)
\medskip
