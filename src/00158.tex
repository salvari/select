Given two lengths of solid metal wire with round cross-sections, which one will have the least electrical resistance: one that is small-diameter, or one that is large-diameter?  Assume all other factors are equal (same metal type, same wire length, etc.).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The large-diameter wire will have less electrical resistance than the small-diameter wire.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Many analogies exist to express this concept: water through a pipe, compressed air through a hose, etc.  Which pipe or hose is less restrictive: the skinny one or the fat one?
