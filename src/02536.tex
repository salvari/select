In this circuit, one amplifier feeds into an {\it attenuator} circuit, which then feeds into a second amplifier stage.  Calculate the "gain" of the attenuator, and then calculate the overall voltage gain of this three-stage circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02536x01.eps}$$

Also, convert the voltage gains of each stage into units of decibels, then convert the overall voltage gain ratio into units of decibels as well.

What do you notice about the overall gain of this circuit in relation to the individual amplifier gains, compared as ratios versus compared as decibel figures?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Cascaded voltage gains expressed as ratios:

$$A_{V} = 5 \times \left( {1 \over 2} \right) \times 4 = 10$$

Cascaded voltage gains expressed a decibel figures:

$$A_{V} = 13.98 \hbox{ dB} + (-6.02 \hbox{ dB}) + 12.04 = 20 \hbox{ dB}$$

Besides providing practice with ratio-to-decibel conversions, the purpose of this question is for students to realize that gains multiply as ratios but add as decibels.
