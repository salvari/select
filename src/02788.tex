%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that the input states in this circuit are defined by the voltage levels, not by the contact status.  In other words, a closed contact equals a "low" (0) logic state.

The choice of diodes is not critical in a circuit where the inputs come from manually actuated switches.  Neither is the choice of resistor sizes (10 k$\Omega$) works just fine, especially when the only thing loading the output is the student's logic probe or voltmeter.
