%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source.  I recommend against using line-power AC because of strong harmonic frequencies which may be present (due to nonlinear loads operating on the same power circuit).  Specify a standard inductor value.

If students are to use a multimeter to make their current and voltage measurements, be sure it is capable of accurate measurement at the circuit frequency!  Inexpensive digital multimeters often experience difficulty measuring AC voltage and current toward the high end of the audio-frequency range.
