Explain what will happen to the unmagnetized rotor when 3-phase AC power is applied to the stationary electromagnet coils.  Note that the rotor is actually a short-circuited electromagnet:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The rotor will rotate due to the action of Lenz's Law.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what would happen if the rotor's coil were to become open-circuited?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, we see a practical 3-phase {\it induction} motor.  Be sure to thoroughly discuss what is necessary to increase or decrease rotor speed, and compare this with what is necessary to increase or decrease speed in a DC motor.
