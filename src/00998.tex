Calculate the amount of gate-to-source voltage necessary to regulate a JFET's drain current at a value of 2.5 mA, given the following transistor parameters:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{GS(off)} =$ 3 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{DSS} =$ 17 mA
\medskip

Also, write the equation used for obtaining the value of $V_{GS}$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{GS} =$ 1.85 volts

$$V_{GS} = V_{GS(off)}\Biggl( 1 - \sqrt{I_D \over I_{DSS}} \Biggr)$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Once students have found the standard drain current formula (transconductance equation), the rest is algebraic manipulation.
