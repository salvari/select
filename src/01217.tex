%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_{load} = 33$ $\Omega$ (approximate)

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain the mathematics behind this answer.  What procedure gives them the quantity of 33 $\Omega$ from the given component values?  Why is this answer only approximate?  What factors might affect it?

Also, ask your students to explain why the common-collector transistor stage does not require a biasing network or coupling capacitor, as the common-emitter stage does.
