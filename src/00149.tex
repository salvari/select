What is the difference between {\it DC} and {\it AC} electricity?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it DC} is an acronym meaning {\it Direct Current}: that is, electrical current that moves in one direction only.  {\it AC} is an acronym meaning {\it Alternating Current}: that is, electrical current that periodically reverses direction ("alternates").

It is important to realize that "DC" and "AC" may also be used to represent {\it voltage} as well as current.  That is, it is possible to have a voltage that alternates back and forth in polarity ("AC" voltage) just as it is possible to have a current that alternates back and forth in direction of motion.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Though it may seem oxymoronic to refer to either "DC" or "AC" voltage (Direct Current voltage, or Alternating Current voltage -- "current voltage"?), the usage of these acronyms as such is commonplace.
