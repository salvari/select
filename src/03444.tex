What type of diode is always packaged in a clear glass or plastic body (as opposed to an opaque plastic body)?  Explain how the appearance of the component is helpful in determining its identity.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a nasty, trick question!  The physical appearance of any semiconductor component is a poor indication of its identity.  Many small zener diodes are packaged in clear bodies, but this does not mean all clear-bodied diodes are zeners, nor that all zeners are found in clear packages!  The {\it part number} of a diode is the only reliable indicator of its identity.

Follow-up question: the physical {\it size} of a component is often an indication of what performance parameter?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I usually do not ask "trick" questions such as this, but occasionally they work really well to get the point across.
