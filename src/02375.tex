{\it Overload heaters} are special overcurrent protection devices commonly used in electric motor control circuits.  Explain how overload heaters perform a function similar to that of {\it fuses}, and also explain how overload heaters differ from fuses.  In other words, identify both the similarities and dis-similarities between overload heaters and fuses.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)
