Write the Boolean expression for this relay logic circuit (without simplification), then reduce the expression to its simplest form and draw a new relay circuit based on the simplified expression:

$$\epsfbox{02926x01.eps}$$

Original Boolean expression:

\vskip 10pt

New circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02926x02.eps}$$
