%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In this activity, students are asked to figure out the details of configuring the ADC: what power supply voltage to use, what resistor values, etc.  The best source for this information is the ADC's datasheet!

For those students who have trouble figuring out how to calculate resolution, I recommend the following formula:

$$V_{resolution} = {V_{range} \over {2^n - 1}}$$

\noindent
Where,

$V_{range}$ = "Span" of analog voltage input (how many volts of range it has from 00000000 to 11111111)

$n$ = Number of output bits for the ADC
