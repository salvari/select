%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it Modulation} is the act of impressing information onto an otherwise featureless stream of matter or energy, usually for the sake of communicating that information over a long distance.  Radio is a very common example of modulation, but I'll let you research a few more on your own!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are many examples of modulation that students can find for presentation, and not all of them are electronic.  Challenge them to think of scenarios other than modern electronic and/or optical communication schemes where modulation of some kind is employed.
