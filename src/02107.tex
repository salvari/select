Use a triangle to calculate the total voltage of the source for this series RC circuit, given the voltage drop across each component:

$$\epsfbox{02107x01.eps}$$

Explain what equation(s) you use to calculate $V_{total}$, as well as why we must geometrically add these voltages together.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{total}$ = 3.672 volts, as calculated by the Pythagorean Theorem

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to have students show you the form of the Pythagorean Theorem, rather than showing them yourself, since it is so easy for students to research on their own.
