Determine an equivalent {\it parallel} RC network for the series RC network shown on the left:

$$\epsfbox{01540x01.eps}$$

Note that I have already provided a value for the capacitor's reactance ($X_C$), which of course will be valid only for a particular frequency.  Determine what values of resistance ($R$) and reactance ($X_C$) in the parallel network will yield the exact same total impedance ($Z_T$) at the same signal frequency.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R =$ 150 $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$X_C =$ 200 $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain how you could check your conversion calculations, to ensure both networks are truly equivalent to each other.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This problem just happens to work out with whole numbers.  Believe it or not, I chose these numbers entirely by accident one day, when setting up an example problem to show a student how to convert between series and parallel equivalent networks!
