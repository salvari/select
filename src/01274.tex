What is the typical power supply voltage range for a CD4xxx series (or MC4xxx series) CMOS logic gate?  How does this compare with the allowable power supply voltage range for a standard (5 volt) TTL logic gate?  Consult a datasheet for your answer.

This question gets students in the habit of consulting datasheets to obtain information on logic gate circuits.  Datasheets are a wealth of technical information, and students absolutely have to become adept at referencing them to obtain the information they need to build and troubleshoot logic circuits.
