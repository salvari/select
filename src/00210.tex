Suppose you wished to build a component with no other purpose than to provide inductance in an electric circuit (an {\it inductor}).  How might you design such a device to perform this function, and how could you maximize its inductance?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you determine how an inductor is constructed, from your own research.

\vskip 10pt

To increase inductance: 

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Increase number of "turns" in coil
\item{$\bullet$} Increase diameter of coil
\item{$\bullet$} Decrease length of coil
\item{$\bullet$} Increase permeability of core material
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

These factors are important to understand for comprehending the function of variable inductors.  Be sure to bring up the subject of variable inductors in your discussion with students.
