Sum-of-Products (SOP) expressions may be implemented by a combination of AND and OR gates, as such:

$$\epsfbox{02860x01.eps}$$

Use DeMorgan's Theorem to prove that this NAND gate circuit performs the exact same function:

$$\epsfbox{02860x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02860}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll leave the proof up to you!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very practical application of DeMorgan's Theorem.  Being able to use all NAND gates to implement an SOP function is a bonus over having to use separate AND and OR integrated circuit packages (one IC instead of two in this particular case).
