A student attempts to build a circuit that will turn a DC motor on and off with a very delicate (low current rating) pushbutton switch.  Unfortunately, there is something wrong with the circuit, because the motor does not turn on no matter what is done with the switch:

Correct the error(s) in this circuit, showing how it must be set up so that the transistor functions as intended.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is very important for your students to learn how the base current controls the collector current in a BJT, and how to use this knowledge to properly set up switching circuits.  This is not difficult to learn, but it takes time and practice for many students to master.  Be sure to spend adequate time discussing this concept (and circuit design techniques) so they all understand.
