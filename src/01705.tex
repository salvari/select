As in all technician tasks, safety must be your first priority.  Soldering harbors specific dangers of its own that you need to be aware of.  Explain what precautions you need to take with regard to the following aspects of soldering:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Safe handling of soldering iron/gun
\item{$\bullet$} Safe handling of solder and flux
\item{$\bullet$} Personal protective equipment
\item{$\bullet$} What to do (and not do) after soldering

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Safe handling of soldering iron/gun}

\item{$\bullet$} Never hold it by the metal end -- always by the handle!
\item{$\bullet$} Place iron on a stand when idle, and be careful that no flammable materials contact it.
\item{$\bullet$} Never leave the iron on, unattended.

\noindent
{\bf Safe handling of solder and flux}

\item{$\bullet$} Never hold solder in your mouth, as it contains heavy metals that are not healthy for your body.
\item{$\bullet$} Avoid breathing fumes -- use a ventilation hood if available.
\item{$\bullet$} Do not eat food while soldering.
\item{$\bullet$} Wash your hands after soldering.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf Personal protective equipment}

\item{$\bullet$} Safety glasses or goggles -- an absolute {\it must!}
\item{$\bullet$} If soldering large wires, use heat-resistant gloves.

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf What to do (and not do) after soldering}

\item{$\bullet$} Clean up worksite.
\item{$\bullet$} Give the soldering iron enough time to cool down before putting it away.
\item{$\bullet$} Put soldering equipment away where it belongs, and where others can find it.
\item{$\bullet$} Never leave the iron on, unattended.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Much of this is common sense, but some of it is not.  Students must realize that even though soldering is a relatively low-temperature process, it is still hot enough to start fires and burn skin.  Also, molten droplets of solder can cause major damage to the eyes, so safety glasses/goggles are imperative.
