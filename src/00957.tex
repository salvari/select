Describe the functions of resistors R1 and R2, and capacitor C1, in this amplifier circuit.  What purpose do they serve?

$$\epsfbox{00957x01.eps}$$

Would it be possible for this amplifier circuit to operate in Class A mode without this voltage divider/capacitor network?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Resistors R1 and R2 produce a DC biasing voltage, and capacitor C1 "couples" the AC input signal to the biasing network, preventing any DC bias from the signal source to influence the amplifier's Q point.

While other biasing networks are possible for a Class A amplifier circuit, some type of DC bias voltage is necessary to make a bipolar junction transistor operate in Class A mode.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the meaning of "Class A" amplification, and why DC biasing is necessary in order to achieve this mode of operation in a BJT circuit.
