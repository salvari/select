In this battery-switch-lamp circuit, the metal filament wire inside the lamp has burned up, so that it no longer forms an electrically continuous connection.  In other words, the filament has failed "open."

$$\epsfbox{03304x01.eps}$$

Of course, this means the lamp will not turn on, no matter what is done with the switch.  It also means that most of the voltage measurements taken in the circuit will be the same as with a properly operating circuit.  There is, however, {\it one} voltage measurement which will be different in the circuit with the burned-out filament than in a properly working circuit.  Identify what pair or pairs of terminal block points this different voltage will be measured between, what switch state (ON or OFF) it will appear in, and what this different voltage measurement will actually be relative to the battery voltage.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

With the filament burned open, the only voltage measurement that will change in the circuit is the voltage across the switch when it is in the OFF state.  Normally, the voltage across the switch in the OFF state will be full battery voltage, but now (with the open filament) it will be zero.  I will let you determine which points in the circuit you may measure switch voltage between.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to ask your students why they think there will be no voltage dropped across the switch when it is OFF, now that the filament has burned open.  It may be helpful to draw a schematic diagram (without all the terminal block points shown) as you discuss the reasoning with your students.
