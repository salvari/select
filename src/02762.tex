Crude logic gates circuits may be constructed out of nothing but diodes and resistors.  Take for example this logic gate circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02762x01.eps}$$

Identify what type of logic function is represented by this gate circuit (AND, OR, inverter, etc.).  Also, trace the directions of all currents in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an AND gate circuit.

$$\epsfbox{02762x02.eps}$$

Follow-up question: show how the two SPDT switches could be replaced by SPST switches (without the need for pullup or pulldown resistors).

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: explain why it may be impractical to design this diode-resistor gate circuit to directly drive an LED so that it lights up when the output state is "high."

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Diode-resistor gate circuits such as this are rarely used in real digital circuitry because they have no capacity to {\it amplify} weak input signals.  They also have no capacity for signal inversion, rendering them incapable of representing a great many logic function types.  Gates made from transistors are much preferred over diode-resistor technology.
