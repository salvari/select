Identify the type of oscillator circuit shown in this schematic diagram, and explain the purpose of the crystal:

$$\epsfbox{01083x01.eps}$$

Challenge question: this type of oscillator circuit is usually limited to lower power outputs than either Hartley or Colpitts designs.  Explain why.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it Pierce} oscillator circuit, and the crystal plays the same role that a tank circuit would in a Hartley or Colpitts oscillator.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how the oscillator circuit's natural frequency may be altered.  How does this differ from frequency control in either the Hartley or Colpitts designs?
