The following circuit allows a capacitor to be rapidly charged and slowly discharged:

$$\epsfbox{03552x01.eps}$$

Suppose that the switch was left in the "charge" position for some substantial amount of time.  Then, someone moves the switch to the "discharge" position to let the capacitor discharge.  Calculate the amount of capacitor voltage and capacitor current at exactly 3 seconds after moving the switch to the "discharge" position.

\vskip 10pt

$V_C$ = \underbar{\hskip 70pt} @ $t$ = 3 seconds

\vskip 10pt

$I_C$ = \underbar{\hskip 70pt} @ $t$ = 3 seconds

\vskip 10pt

Also, show the direction of discharge current in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_C$ = \underbar{1.9915 volts} @ $t$ = 3 seconds

\vskip 10pt

$I_C$ = \underbar{995.74 $\mu$A} @ $t$ = 3 seconds

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, students must choose which equation(s) to use for the calculation, calculate the time constant for the circuit, and put all the variables in the right place to obtain the correct answers.  Discuss all these steps with your students, allowing them to explain how they approached the question.

If anyone asks, let them know that the capacitor symbol shown represents a polarized (electrolytic) capacitor.
