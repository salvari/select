%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply a suitable DC voltage for the incandescent lamp.  Set the power supply current limit such that it outputs enough to blow the fuse, but not enough to damage anything else.  The fuse needs to be rated for a current value practical for a reasonable number of parallel-connected lamps.
