Determine what would happen to the voltage gain of a common-emitter transistor amplifier circuit if the following resistance values were changed (consider one change at a time):

$$\epsfbox{02231x01.eps}$$

\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_C$ increased; $A_V$ . . .
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_E$ increased; $A_V$ . . .
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_{bias1}$ increased; $A_V$ . . .
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_{bias2}$ increased; $A_V$ . . .

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_C$ increased; $A_V$ {\it increases}
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_E$ increased; $A_V$ {\it decreases}
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_{bias1}$ increased; $A_V$ {\it does not change}
\item{$\bullet$} Resistance $R_{bias2}$ increased; $A_V$ {\it does not change}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to apply their knowledge of common-emitter amplifier voltage gain to hypothetical changes in resistance.  These are important concepts, so be sure to discuss them adequately, challenging your students to explain {\it why} the voltage gain is affected as described, not just explained by blindly following a gain formula.

Many students experience difficulty understanding why voltage gain is directly proportional to collector resistance.  What they visualize when they consider a greater collector resistance is {\it less} collector voltage, which they understandably equate to less output signal and thus less gain.  While the quiescent (DC) output voltage {\it does} decrease with increasing $R_C$, what is not so obvious is that {\it change in collector voltage} ($\Delta V_C$) increases with increasing $R_C$.

Ask your students to explain why changes in bias resistor values do not (significantly) effect voltage gain.  Does this mean the values are arbitrary?  Discuss with them the purpose of bias resistors, if necessary, and what would happen if they were not there or if they were grossly mis-sized.
