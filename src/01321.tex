Suppose you needed an inverter gate in a logic circuit, but none were available.  You do, however, have a spare (unused) NOR gate in one of the integrated circuits.  Show how you would connect a NOR gate to function as an inverter.

Use Boolean algebra to show that your solution is valid.

$$\epsfbox{01321x01.eps}$$

For the above solution: $\overline{A + A} = \overline{A}$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: are there any other ways to use a NOR gate as an inverter?  The method shown above is not the only valid solution!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Not only is the method shown in the answer not the only valid solution, but it may even be the worst one!  Your students should be able to research or invent alternative inverter connections, so after asking them to present their alternatives, ask the class as a whole to decide which solution is better.  Ask them to consider electrical parameters, such as propagation delay time and fan-out.
