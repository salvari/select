Small relays often come packaged in clear, rectangular, plastic cases, which had led to the name {\it ice cube relay} to be commonly applied to them.  These so-called "ice cube" relays have either eight or eleven pins protruding from the bottom, allowing them to be plugged into a special socket for connection with wires in a circuit:

Draw the necessary connecting wires between terminals in this circuit, so that actuating the normally-open pushbutton switch will energize the relay, which will in turn supply electrical power to the motor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

"Ice cube" style relays are very common in industry, and it is important that students understand how to interpret the pin diagrams on the cases in order to use them in new circuits and to troubleshoot relay circuits that are already built.
