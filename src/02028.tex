%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Source dissipation will be maximized at $R_{load}$ = 0 $\Omega$.  Surprised at this answer?  Expecting power to be maximized at $R_{load} = R_{source}$, perhaps?  If so, you have misunderstood the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The wrong answer anticipated in the "Answer" section reflects a common student misconception, and a tendency to memorize simple rules rather than {\it think} and analyze circuit behavior.  Remind your students that the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem specifies what value the {\it load} resistance should be at to maximize power dissipation {\it at that same load}, not elsewhere.
