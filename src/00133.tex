When a pulse propagates down an "unterminated" cable and reaches an open-circuit, what does it do?  Does it simply vanish, or does it go some place else?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A voltage pulse, upon reaching the open end of a cable, will be "reflected" back in the direction from which it came, its polarity being maintained while the current moves in the opposite direction.

$$\epsfbox{00133x01.eps}$$

After the reflected pulse reaches the source, there will be maximum voltage at the source terminals and zero current in the cable.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

To help answer this question, it is helpful to ask students how voltage and current relate to each other in an open-circuit condition (maximum voltage, zero current).
