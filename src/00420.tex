Suppose the electrical power supplied to a commercial building is labeled as "208/120 volt".  What does this label mean, exactly?  Relate this description to a schematic diagram.

Many students are confused by this when seeing it for the first time.  How is it possible to measure voltage between two points in a circuit and obtain 208 volts, when the two series-connected voltage sources between those two points are 120 volts each?  Why isn't it 240/120 volts instead?

The answer to this question, of course, is {\it phase shift}: the answer to most "strange" phenomenon in AC circuits!
