Predict how the operation of this operational amplifier circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Specifically, identify whether the output voltage ($V_{out}$) will move in a positive direction (closer to the +V rail) or in a negative direction (closer to the -V rail).  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
