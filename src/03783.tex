Predict how the operation of this precision rectifier circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03783x01.eps}$$

\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:

\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails open:

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ becomes equal to 0 volts all the time.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ saturates negative when $V_{in}$ is positive, and $V_{out}$ floats up to +1.4 volts when $V_{in}$ is negative (depending on how the output is loaded by another circuit).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open: {\it Normal operation when $V_{in}$ is positive ($V_{out} = - V_{in}$), $V_{out} = V_{in}$ when $V_{in}$ is negative (full-wave, inverted rectification!).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails open: {\it Normal operation when $V_{in}$ is negative ($V_{out}$ = 0 volts), $V_{out} = V_{in}$ when $V_{in}$ is positive (half-wave, non-inverted rectification!).}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
