What factors determine where potentiometers $R_{pot1}$ and $R_{pot2}$ must be set?  Why are they "trimmer" potentiometers (as indicated by the special wiper symbol) and not regular panel-mount potentiometers?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The acceptable "high" and "low" voltage levels for which ever logic family is being trouble-shot will dictate where these potentiometers must be set.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Do {\it not} simply tell your students what these acceptable voltage levels are!  Let them research datasheets for instances of logic gates within the logic family desired, and let the manufacturers' data tell them what they need to know.
