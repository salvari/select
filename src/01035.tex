A practical {\it current source} may be built using a battery and a special semiconductor component known as a {\it current-limiting diode}:

$$\epsfbox{01035x01.eps}$$

The current-limiting diode acts as a variable resistance, to regulate current through it at a constant value: if current increases, its resistance increases to reduce the current back to where it should be; if current decreases, its resistance decreases to increase current up to where it should be.

Determine the amount of voltage output by an open-circuited (ideal) current source.  Contrast this with the voltage output by the practical current source shown in the diagram.  Finally, draw an equivalent circuit showing an ideal current source somehow connected to a resistance in such a way that its open-circuited output voltage is identical to the practical current source.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

An ideal current source outputs infinite voltage when open-circuited.  The practical current source shown in the diagram outputs 24 volts.

Equivalent circuit:

Follow-up question: the more "ideal" a current source is, the ({\it choose one: greater, or less}) its internal resistance will be.  Compare this with the internal resistance of an ideal voltage source.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A point of difficulty with some students is the word {\it infinite}.  I have found it surprisingly common for students to confuse the concept "infinite" with the concept "infinitesimal".  If any of your students are confused in the same manner, it will become evident when they try to explain the open-circuit output voltage of an ideal current source.
