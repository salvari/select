Calculate the voltage dropped by each of these resistors, given a battery voltage of 9 volts.  The resistor color codes are as follows (assume 0\% error on all resistor values):

\medskip
\item {}$R_1 = $ Brn, Grn, Red, Gld
\item {}$R_2 = $ Yel, Vio, Org, Gld
\item {}$R_3 = $ Red, Grn, Red, Gld
\item {}$R_4 = $ Wht, Blk, Red, Gld
\medskip

Now, re-calculate all resistor voltage drops for a scenario where the total voltage is different:

\smallskip

\settabs 2 \columns
\+ First scenario:         &  Second scenario: \cr
\+ $E_{R1} = 0.225$ volts  &  $E_{R1} = 0.45$ volts \cr
\+ $E_{R2} = 7.05$ volts   &  $E_{R2} = 14.1$ volts \cr
\+ $E_{R3} = 0.375$ volts  &  $E_{R3} = 0.75$ volts \cr
\+ $E_{R4} = 1.35$ volts   &  $E_{R4} = 2.7$ volts \cr

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what do you notice about the {\it ratios} of the voltages between the two scenarios?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students if they notice any pattern between the voltage drops of the first scenario and the voltage drops of the second scenario.  What does this pattern tell us about the nature of voltage divider circuits?
