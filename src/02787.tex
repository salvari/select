%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The choice of diodes is not critical in a circuit where the inputs come from manually actuated switches.  Neither is the choice of resistor sizes (10 k$\Omega$) works just fine, especially when the only thing loading the output is the student's logic probe or voltmeter.
