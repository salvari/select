A resistive DC load receives pulse-width modulated (PWM) power from a controller circuit, and an oscilloscope shows the load voltage waveform as such:

$$\epsfbox{03863x01.eps}$$

Calculate the duty cycle of this waveform, and also the average power dissipated by the load assuming a load resistance of 7.2 $\Omega$.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Duty cycle $\approx$ 25\%

$P_{average}$ $\approx$ 781.3 W
