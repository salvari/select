%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The ohmmeter should register a very high resistance.

Ask your students {\it why} a voltmeter should have a very high resistance (many thousands or millions of ohms) between its test leads.  How does this property of all voltmeters relate to how they are used to measured current in real circuits?
