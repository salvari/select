Determine what sort of time-delay relay this circuit is:

$$\epsfbox{04029x01.eps}$$

Also, calculate the amount of delay, in seconds.  Hint: the 555's timing capacitor will charge from 0 volts to $2 \over 3$ supply voltage during the charging cycle.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it normally-open, timed-closed} (also known as a {\it normally-open, on-delay}) relay, with a time delay of 4.065 seconds.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may mistakenly base their time calculations on the 10 k$\Omega$ resistor and/or the 0.1 $\mu$F capacitor.  Discuss the role of these two components in triggering the 555 timer, and how the time delay of the relay is actually set by the {\it other} $R$ and $C$.
