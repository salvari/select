The following battery-switch-lamp circuit has a problem.  Over time, corrosion has developed between the wire end and the screw terminal labeled "4" on the upper side of the top terminal block.  This corroded connection now has a high resistance instead of a low resistance as it should.  As a result, the light bulb does not energize when the switch is turned ON:

$$\epsfbox{03303x01.eps}$$

Taking voltage measurements with a voltmeter, how do you think this corrosion problem will reveal itself with the switch on the ON position?  In other words, which voltage measurement in this circuit (i.e. between which pair or pairs of terminal block points) will be unusual as a result of the bad connection at point \#4, and approximately how much voltage should that measurement be?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

With the corroded connection at terminal \#4, the following voltage measurements should read abnormally high (almost full battery voltage, whereas they {\it should} register zero volts if all connections in the circuit are good):

\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Points 1 and 4
\item{$\bullet$} Points 1 and 9
\item{$\bullet$} Points 1 and 10
\medskip

Follow-up question: there are also several voltage measurements in this faulty circuit that will read abnormally {\it low} as a result of the corroded connection at point \#4.  Identify which pairs of points the abnormally low voltage will be measured between.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Explain to your students what environmental factors contribute to corrosion (water, acids, caustics, etc.) and how a corroded electrical connection is usually not equivalent to a complete "open" break in a circuit.  Quite often a corroded connection is a substantial resistance of unstable value, leading to intermittent problems in the circuit.
