A useful test instrument for digital gate circuit troubleshooting is a {\it logic pulser}.  Explain what one is and give an example of how it is used.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Since most digital electronics textbooks discuss logic pulsers along with logic probes, I'll let you do the research here and share with your classmates and instructor what you found!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students may wonder how a logic pulser is able to override the output state of any gate it's connected to.  The answer has to do with the brief time that a pulser operates, and also the pulser's low impedance (compared to the relatively high impedance of the overridden gate output).
