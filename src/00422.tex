This electric motor was operating just fine, then one day it mysteriously shut down.  The electrician discovered two blown fuses, which he then replaced:

$$\epsfbox{00422x01.eps}$$

When the on/off switch was closed again, the motor made a loud "humming" noise, then became quiet after a few seconds.  It never turned, though.  Upon inspection, the electrician discovered the same two fuses had blown again.

If you were asked to help troubleshoot this electric motor circuit, what would you recommend as the next step?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Obviously, something is wrong with the circuit, if it keeps blowing the same two fuses.  So, the answer is {\it not}, "Install larger fuses!"

It would make sense to proceed by answering this question: what type of fault typically blows fuses?  What types of tests could you perform on a circuit like this in order to locate those types of faults?  Bear in mind that the behavior of electric motors is quite unlike many other types of loads.  This is an electromechanical device, so the problem may not necessarily be limited to electrical faults!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question should provoke some interesting discussion!  An interesting "twist" to this problem is to suggest (after some discussion) that the motor itself checks out fine when tested with an ohmmeter (no ground faults, no open or shorted windings), and that its shaft may be turned freely by hand.  What could possibly be the source of trouble now?
