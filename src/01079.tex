Explain the principle of operation in this {\it astable multivibrator} circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01079x01.eps}$$

Also, identify where you would connect to this circuit to obtain an output signal.  What type of signal would it be (sine wave, square wave, ramp or triangle wave, etc.)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A square-wave output signal may be obtained at the collector of either transistor.  I'll let you research this circuit's principle of operation.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how the frequency of this circuit could be altered.  After that, ask them what they would have to do to alter the {\it duty cycle} of this circuit's oscillation.
