One method used to bias enhancement-mode IGFETs is {\it drain-feedback} biasing.  An example is shown here:

$$\epsfbox{01194x01.eps}$$

Another method of biasing enhancement-mode IGFETs is the {\it voltage divider} technique, which should be familiar to you from your understanding of BJT amplifier circuits:

$$\epsfbox{01194x02.eps}$$

How do you think the performance of these two differently-biased circuits compare?  Assuming they were both biased for the same Q-point, would there be any significant difference(s) in their signal amplifying performance?  Why or why not?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

One of these circuits has the potential for much greater voltage gain.  I'll let you determine which one, and more importantly, why.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is a good test of your students' comprehension of feedback in transistor circuits: what it is, what causes it, and what its effects are.

Ask your students whether they think the technique of drain-feedback biasing would work in a depletion-mode IGFET amplifier circuit.
