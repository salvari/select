Solve this equation for the value of $x$:

$$x + 5 = 8$$

How many exact solutions does the above equation have?

\vskip 20pt

Now, determine a few {\it different} solutions for the following equation:

$$x + y = 8$$

How many exact solutions does this equation have?  Plot this equation's solutions on the following graph:

$$\epsfbox{03091x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\hbox{If } x + 5 = 8 \hbox{ , then } x = 3 \hbox{ (exactly one solution)}$$

$$\hbox{If } x + y = 8 \hbox{ , then there are an infinite number of solutions:}$$

$$\epsfbox{03091x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: find the solution to $x + 5 = 8$ on this same graph.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question begins with an extremely simple equation having one solution and moves on to another simple equation having an infinite number of solutions.  While an infinitude of correct answers may seem impossible to rationally deal with, a graph handles it quite nicely, the multitude of correct answer pairs represented as a line on a graph with infinite length.
