Suppose a JFET amplifier circuit is self-biased so that 1.5 mA of quiescent (DC) current goes through its drain terminal with no AC input signal applied:

$$\epsfbox{03889x01.eps}$$

Calculate the following quiescent voltages:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Gate-to-ground DC voltage ($V_G$) = 
\item{$\bullet$} Source-to-ground DC voltage ($V_S$) =
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-ground DC voltage ($V_D$) =
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-Source DC voltage ($V_{DS}$) =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Gate-to-ground DC voltage ($V_G$) = 0 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Source-to-ground DC voltage ($V_S$) = 3.30 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-ground DC voltage ($V_D$) = 20.18 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-Source DC voltage ($V_{DS}$) = 16.88 volts
