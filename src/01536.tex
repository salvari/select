While Class A amplifier circuits are simpler to design and build, they are rarely used for high-power applications.  Why is this?  Why are Class B amplifier designs much more popular for high-power applications?  Would it be practical for you to build a microphone amplifier such as this using nothing but Class A circuitry?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Class A amplifiers are much less {\it efficient} than Class B amplifiers: a great deal more of the electrical power energizing the circuit gets wasted in the form of heat.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the practicality of a Class A audio power amplifier for the scope of this project.  Just because I made Class B circuitry a requirement of this project does not mean a Class A amplifier design would be completely impractical.  One of my goals in writing this design project was to get students experienced with Class B push-pull circuits, which are more challenging to design and build than Class A.
