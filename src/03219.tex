It should be obvious that the load voltage in this resistive voltage divider circuit will be less than 30 volts AC (RMS):

$$\epsfbox{03219x01.eps}$$

Likewise, it should be apparent that the load voltage in this {\it inductive} voltage divider circuit will be less than 30 volts AC (RMS):

$$\epsfbox{03219x02.eps}$$

From this brief analysis it would appear these two voltage divider circuits are equivalent to one another.  However, there is a very important difference in terms of {\it current}: load versus supply.  Estimate the load and source currents in each of these divider circuits, and comment on the difference(s) between the two.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In the resistive circuit, the load current will be less than the supply current.  In the inductive (autotransformer) circuit, though, the load current will exceed the source current!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to determine which voltage divider circuit will be more energy-efficient.
