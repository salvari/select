Graph both the capacitor voltage ($V_C$) and the capacitor current ($I_C$) over time as the switch is closed in this circuit.  Assume the capacitor begins in a complete uncharged state (0 volts):

$$\epsfbox{03550x01.eps}$$

Then, select and modify the appropriate form of equation (from below) to describe each plot:

$$e^{-{t \over \tau}} \hbox{\hskip 60pt} 1 - e^{-{t \over \tau}}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{03550x02.eps}$$

$$I_C = I_{max} \left(e^{-{t \over \tau}}\right)$$

$$V_C = V_{max} \left(1 - e^{-{t \over \tau}}\right)$$

Have your students explain why the voltage and current curves are shaped as they are.
