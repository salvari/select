Suppose I desired to power the light bulbs in a remote cabin with solar power, charging a large battery bank.  The battery bank needs to be able to power ten 60-watt light bulbs for eight hours without being recharged.  The system voltage is 115 volts.  How large must the battery bank be, in total amp-hours?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

At least 41.7 amp-hours of capacity is needed, at 115 volts.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what they would recommend for a battery bank capacity if they were designing this system.  Would they specify 41.7 amp-hours exactly?  Why or why not?
