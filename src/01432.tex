An important measurement of pulse waveforms is {\it duty cycle}.  Give a precise. mathematical definition for this term.

\vskip 10pt

Also, write an equation solving for pulse width given duty cycle ($D$) and frequency ($f$).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Duty cycle" is a measure of a pulse waveform's {\it on} time versus its {\it total} time (period):

$$D = {t_{on} \over t_{total}}$$

I'll let you figure out how to write an equation solving for pulse width ($t_{on}$) in terms of duty cycle and frequency.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Duty cycle is a very important concept, as analog information may be conveyed through the variable duty cycle of an otherwise digital pulse waveform.  Discuss this application with your students, if time permits.
