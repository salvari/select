%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$A = P + N$$

$$Z = P$$

\noindent
Where,

$P =$ Number of protons

$N =$ Number of neutrons

$A =$ Atomic mass

$Z =$ Atomic number

%(END_ANSWER)

Admittedly, this is not a challenging problem in algebra, but it is important to introduce practical algebra to students in a gentle way at first.  You may be surprised how many students have a theoretical knowledge of mathematics only, and find it difficult to apply even simple algebraic principles to realistic situations.
