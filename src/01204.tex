Convert the following numbers from decimal (base-ten) to binary (base-two):

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $7_{10}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $10_{10}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $19_{10}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $250_{10}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $511_{10}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $824_{10}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $1044_{10}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $9241_{10}$ =
\medskip

\item{$\bullet$} $7_{10}$ = $111_2$
\item{$\bullet$} $10_{10}$ = $1010_2$
\item{$\bullet$} $19_{10}$ = $10011_2$
\item{$\bullet$} $250_{10}$ = $11111010_2$
\item{$\bullet$} $511_{10}$ = $111111111_2$
\item{$\bullet$} $824_{10}$ = $1100111000_2$
\item{$\bullet$} $1044_{10}$ = $10000010100_2$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The most important part of this question, of course, is the {\it method} of translating decimal into binary.  Don't tell your students how to do this, as there are plenty of good references to be found on the procedure.  If a student cannot research and understand how to convert decimal into binary without your help, they aren't trying hard enough!
