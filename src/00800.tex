Shown here is a simplified schematic diagram of one of the operational amplifiers inside a TL08x (TL081, TL082, or TL084) op-amp integrated circuit:

$$\epsfbox{00800x01.eps}$$

Qualitatively determine what will happen to the output voltage ($V_{out}$) if the voltage on the noninverting input ($V_{in+}$) increases, and the voltage on the inverting input ($V_{in-}$) remains the same (all voltages are positive quantities, referenced to -V).  Explain what happens at every stage of the op-amp circuit (voltages increasing or decreasing, currents increasing or decreasing) with this change in input voltage.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here, I've labeled a few of the important voltage changes in the circuit, resulting from the increase in noninverting input voltage ($V_{in+}$):

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer provided here is minimal.  Challenge your students to follow the whole circuit through until the end, qualitatively assessing voltage and current changes.

Incidentally, the strange-looking double-circle symbol is a {\it current source}.  Ask your students if they were able to find a reference anywhere describing what this symbol means.
