%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that the input states in this circuit are defined by the voltage levels, not by the contact status.  In other words, a closed contact equals a "low" (0) logic state.

Here are some suggested Boolean expressions for your students to build gate circuits from:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Output = $AB + C$
\item{$\bullet$} Output = $(A + B)C$
\item{$\bullet$} Output = $\overline{A} + BC$
\item{$\bullet$} Output = $\overline{A}B + C$
\medskip
