Explain the difference between a {\it ripple adder} and a {\it look-ahead} adder.  What does the term "ripple" mean in this context?  Why is "ripple" potentially a bad thing for a digital adder circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Ripple" adders update their output bits one at a time rather than simultaneously.  This leads to false, transient output states.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The "ripple" effect seen in simple binary adder circuits is not limited to adders!  Some Gray-to-binary code converters and counter circuits also exhibit ripple, with the same deleterious effects.
