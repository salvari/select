%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Between {\bf C} and {\bf F}: $V_{CF}$ = 48 V
\item{$\bullet$} Between {\bf A} and {\bf B}: $V_{AB}$ = 21.33 V
\item{$\bullet$} Between {\bf D} and {\bf E}: $V_{DE}$ = 10.67 V
\item{$\bullet$} Between {\bf D} and {\bf F}: $V_{DF}$ = 37.33 V

This question checks students' ability to relate the winding ratios of a transformer to voltages in the circuit.  The symbolism here is common in Europe, but not so common in the United States.
