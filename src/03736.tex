Predict how this power supply circuit's output voltage will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Also note whether or not any other components in this circuit will become stressed as a result of each fault.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails shorted: {\it Fuse immediately blows, then output voltage falls to zero (after filter capacitors have discharged).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ secondary winding fails open: {\it Output voltage falls to zero (after filter capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ have discharged).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Rectifying diode $D_3$ fails open: {\it No change in output voltage (except when heavily loaded, where there will be increased ripple voltage).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Zener diode $D_5$ fails open: {\it Output voltage rises to approximately same level as unregulated voltage (across capacitor $C_1$).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Zener diode $D_5$ fails shorted: {\it Output voltage falls to zero (as quickly as $C_2$ can discharge), resistor $R_1$ may overheat.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it Output voltage falls to zero (as quickly as $C_2$ can discharge).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_2$ fails shorted: {\it Output voltage falls to a very low value, transistor $Q_1$ will most likely overheat.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
