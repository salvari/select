%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Transformers are used to step voltage up for efficient transportation over long distances, and used to step the high voltage down again for point-of-use circuits.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain the answer in detail, rather than just repeating what the given answer states.  Why is high-voltage power distribution more efficient than low-voltage distribution?  Why would high voltage have to be stepped down for point-of-use applications?
