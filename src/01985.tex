%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

These are {\it varistors}.  Sometimes they are referred to by the acronym {\it MOV}, which stands for Metal Oxide Varistor.  I'll let you research what is unique about the behavior of these devices.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: plot an approximate graph of current versus voltage for a varistor, and comment on how this compares to the current/voltage characteristic of a normal resistor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to reveal their information sources used when researching varistors, and also if they were able to determine how these devices are constructed.
