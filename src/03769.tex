Predict how the operation of this thermostat circuit (where the cooling fan motor is supposed to turn on when the temperature gets too high) will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03769x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Cable fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Comparator $U_1$ fails with output saturated positive:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Cable fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails shorted (drain-to-source):
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Cable fails open: {\it Fan turns on and never turns off.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Comparator $U_1$ fails with output saturated positive: {\it Fan refuses to turn on.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it Fan refuses to turn on.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Cable fails shorted: {\it Fan refuses to turn on.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails shorted (drain-to-source): {\it Fan turns on and never turns off.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
