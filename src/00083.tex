For a given amount of water pressure, which will flow a greater rate of water: a small (restrictive) nozzle or a large (unrestrictive) nozzle?  Explain how this relates to the study of voltage, current, and resistance in a simple electric circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Obviously, an unrestrictive nozzle will pass a greater flow rate of water through it, all other factors being equal.  In an electric circuit, less resistance will pass a greater flow rate of electrons (current) for a given amount of "pressure" (voltage).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Water flow is not a perfect analogy for electricity, but is close enough to be useful in basic electricity education.  Be prepared to discuss the inadequacies of water as an analogy with your students (i.e. "How come electrons don't spill out the end of an open wire like water spills out the end of an open hose or pipe?").
