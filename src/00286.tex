Suppose an engineer designed a fire alarm system for a large warehouse, with multiple pushbutton switches connected to a single alarm siren:

$$\epsfbox{00286x01.eps}$$

Actuating any of the normally-closed switches results in the alarm sounding.  So far, so good.

Now, suppose that one of the wires connecting one side of several switches to the rest of the circuit breaks open.  What will the result of this failure be?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The alarm will immediate sound -- a false alarm.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what essential task the relay performs in this system.  Is there any way to build this circuit to have the same functionality without using a relay?
