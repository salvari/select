Determine the optimum headphone impedance to achieve maximum power output in this audio amplifier circuit, and also the input impedance of the amplifier circuit (as seen by the MP3 player):

$$\epsfbox{02502x01.eps}$$

$Z_{headphone}$ (optimum) = \hskip 80pt $Z_{input}$ = 

\underbar{file 02502}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Z_{headphone}$ (optimum) = 1000 $\Omega$ \hskip 50pt $Z_{input}$ = 3.6 k$\Omega$
