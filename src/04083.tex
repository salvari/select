Show which directions these free-floating ions would move, if exposed to an electric field of the polarity shown:

$$\epsfbox{04083x01.eps}$$

Note: the "H$^{+}$" ion is a positively charged hydrogen atom, while the "OH$^{-}$" ion is a negatively charged hydroxyl ion.

Follow-up question: which of these metal plates would we call the {\it cathode}, and which would we call the {\it anode}?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The scenario shown is not academic -- it is what happens when an electric field is applied to water.  The dissociated ions move in opposite directions, liberating hydrogen gas at the negative electrode and oxygen gas at the positive.
