Explain each of the mathematical approximations for this typical common-collector amplifier circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02240x01.eps}$$

$$A_V \approx 1$$

$$Z_{in} \approx R_1 \> || \> R_2 \> || \> (\beta + 1)[r'_e + (R_E \> || \> R_{load})]$$

$$Z_{out} \approx R_E \> || \> \left( r'_e + {{R_1 \> || \> R_2 \> || \> R_{source}} \over {\beta + 1}} \right) $$

What does each term in each expression represent, and why do they relate to one another as shown?

The answers I leave for you to figure out!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The approximations for voltage gain, input impedance, and output impedance vary somewhat according to how precise the author(s) intended them to be.  What you see here may be simpler or more complex than what you find in your textbook(s).  The purpose of this question is to summarize gain and impedance calculations for this type of amplifier circuit, as well as to stimulate thought and discussion on the rationale for each.  If students simply try to memorize these equations, they will forget them soon afterward.  If they {\it understand why} each one is as it is from principles previously learned, both comprehension and retention will be much improved.
