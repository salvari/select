%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If you happen to have pieces of conduit available for demonstration, show them to your students during discussion time.  Better yet, take them to a place where they can see electrical conduit in use!

Be sure to ask them questions about the other methods (raceways, wire trays) of laying wire, and how these methods compare with rigid conduit.
