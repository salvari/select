%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

An electric "arc" is a discharge of current through the air.  Arcs may be caused by excessive voltage ionizing an air path between two conductors, or from accidental contact (and subsequent re-separation) between two conductors.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss the subject of "ionization" of gases.  Air is normally an insulator of electricity, but it becomes a conductor when ionized.  Ask your students what happens to a gas when it becomes ionized.  Ask them to tell you what the word "ionized" means.
