Calculate the necessary magnetic flux rate-of-change over time (in units of Webers per second) as well as the direction of magnet motion (either toward or away from the coil) to induce a voltage of 13.5 volts in the polarity shown:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$d \phi \over dt$ must be equal to 0.0964 Webers per second, with the magnet moving away from the coil.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is both a quantitative application of Faraday's Law and an application of Lenz's Law.
