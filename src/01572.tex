At a construction site, several electric "arc" welders are plugged into 480 volt receptacles.  Each receptacle has its own safety disconnect switch and fuse overcurrent protection:

$$\epsfbox{01572x01.eps}$$

You, as an electronics technician working at the job site, happen to be walking past these welders when one of the welding personnel stops you to ask for help.

``You're an electrician, right?''

\vskip 5pt

``Not exactly,'' you reply, ``but maybe I can help you anyway.''

\vskip 5pt

``My welder's dead -- it doesn't even turn on.  Can you check it out?''

\vskip 5pt

You didn't bring your multimeter or any other test equipment, so you can't check for voltage at the receptacle.  As you look around the job site, you notice that no one is using welder \#2.  When you flip it's power switch on, welder \#2 turns on just like it should.  Deciding to apply your "swap interchangeable components" troubleshooting strategy, you turn off both welders' power switches, then turn off the disconnect switches at both receptacles and swap the power cables between receptacles:

$$\epsfbox{01572x02.eps}$$

When you turn the disconnect switches on and try to start both welders, you find that {\it neither} one turns on now!  Switching the power cables back to their original receptacles doesn't make things better, either.  Both welders \#1 and \#2 are still "dead," which is a worse situation than what you first encountered.  This is not good, because the person who called you for help is beginning to cast angry looks in your direction, and you are fairly sure the operator of welder \#2 won't be much happier when he returns to find his welder non-functional as well.

Identify the most likely location of the fault in this system, and explain why the "swap interchangeable components" strategy got you into trouble.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The likely location of the fault is in welder \#1.  I'll let you determine what the nature of this fault most likely is, and why the strategy employed in this scenario probably wasn't the wisest.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This situation is very realistic, and underscores the need for careful thinking on the part of the troubleshooter when deciding what specific troubleshooting strategy to apply.  Despite the undeniable power of the "swap interchangeable components" strategy, it is not fool-proof.
