Suppose you need to build a full-wave bridge rectifier with a current rating of 2.5 amps, but only have model 1N4001 diodes to build it with.  Draw a schematic diagram of the circuit, showing how multiple 1N4001 diodes could be connected together to accomplish this:

Follow-up question: while this circuit should work (in theory), in practice one or more of the diodes will fail prematurely due to overheating.  The fix for this problem is to connect "swamping" resistors in series with the diodes like this:

$$\epsfbox{00946x03.eps}$$

Explain why these resistors are necessary to ensure long diode life.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer to this question should not be much of a challenge to your students, although the follow-up question is a bit challenging.  Ask your students what purpose the swamping resistors serve in this circuit.  What do we know about current through the diodes if one or more of them will fail due to overheating without the swamping resistors?

What value of resistor would your students recommend for this application?  What factors influence their decision regarding the resistance value?

%INDEX% Diodes, paralleling for extra current
