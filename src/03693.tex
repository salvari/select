Suppose you had an AC/DC power supply, which performed as follows (open-circuit and loaded test conditions):

$$\epsfbox{03693x01.eps}$$

Draw a Th\'evenin equivalent circuit to model the behavior of this power supply.

\underbar{file 03693}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{03693x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: is the switch shown in the {\it on} or {\it off} position, in the pictorial diagram?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students how Th\'evenin's theorem allows us to model fairly complex power-supply circuits as simply a voltage source and series resistance (at least approximately).  Discuss also the limitations of this modeling, especially in light of the condition of linearity for the proper application of Th\'evenin's theorem.
