Shown here are two frequency response plots (known as {\it Bode plots}) for a pair of series resonant circuits.  Each circuit has the same inductance and capacitance values, but different resistance values.  The "output" is voltage measured across the resistor of each circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01391x01.eps}$$

Which one of these plots represents the response of the circuit with the greatest $Q$, or {\it quality factor}?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The steeper plot corresponds to the circuit with the greatest $Q$.

Follow-up question: assuming both the inductance and the capacitance values are the same in these two resonant circuits, explain which circuit has the greatest resistance ($R_1$ or $R_2$).

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what does the word "normalized" mean with respect to the vertical axis scale of the Bode plot?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

When your students study resonant filter circuits, they will better understand the importance of $Q$.  For now, though, it is enough that they comprehend the basic notion of how $Q$ impacts the voltage dropped by any one component in a series resonant circuit across a range of frequencies.
