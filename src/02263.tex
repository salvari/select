One way to achieve the phase shift necessary for regenerative feedback in an oscillator circuit is to use multiple RC phase-shifting networks:

$$\epsfbox{02263x01.eps}$$

What must the voltage gain be for the common-emitter amplifier if the total voltage attenuation for the three phase-shifting RC networks is -29.25 dB?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The amplifier's voltage gain must be (at least) +29.25 dB.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question probes students' comprehension of the Barkhausen criterion: that total loop gain must be equal or greater than unity in order for sustained oscillations to occur.
