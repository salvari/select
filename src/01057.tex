Is it safe to close the breaker between these two alternators if their output frequencies are different?  Explain why or why not.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

When the frequencies of two or more AC voltage sources are different, the phase shift(s) between them are constantly changing.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what must be done to make the two alternators' frequencies equal to each other?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to calculate how fast the voltages from these two alternators "roll" in and out of phase with each other.
