Which voltage divider circuit will be {\it least} affected by the connection of identical loads?  Explain your answer.

$$\epsfbox{00359x01.eps}$$

What advantage does the other voltage divider have over the circuit that is least affected by the connection of a load?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The divider circuit with proportionately lower-value resistors will be affected least by the application of a load.  The other divider circuit has the advantage of wasting less energy.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may be confused by the lack of a resistance value given for the load.  Without a given value, how can they proceed with any calculations?  Ask the other students how they solved this problem: how did they overcome the problem of not having a load resistance value to work with?
