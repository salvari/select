Identify what each type of transistor is (MOSFET, JFET, or BJT; N-channel, P-channel, NPN, or PNP, E-type or D-type), and what must be connected to the controlling terminal of each transistor (base or gate) to turn each one {\it on} so that the light bulb energizes:

Follow-up question: for the JFET, which is already "on" with zero voltage applied to the gate, describe what would be necessary to force it into the "off" state.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is very important for students to understand what conditions are necessary to drive any of these transistor types into their "on" states, as a precursor to understanding their function in linear (analog) circuitry.
