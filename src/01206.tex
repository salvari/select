A numeration system often used as a "shorthand" way of writing large binary numbers is the {\it hexadecimal}, or base-sixteen, system.

Based on what you know of place-weighted numeration systems, describe how many valid ciphers exist in the hexadecimal system, and the respective "weights" of each place in a hexadecimal number.

Also, perform the following conversions:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $35_{16}$ into decimal:
\item{$\bullet$} $34_{10}$ into hexadecimal:
\item{$\bullet$} $11100010_{2}$ into hexadecimal:
\item{$\bullet$} $93_{16}$ into binary:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There are sixteen valid ciphers in the hexadecimal system (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F), with each successive place carrying sixteen times the "weight" of the place before it.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $35_{16}$ into decimal: $53_{10}$
\item{$\bullet$} $34_{10}$ into hexadecimal: $22_{16}$
\item{$\bullet$} $11100010_{2}$ into hexadecimal: E2$_{16}$
\item{$\bullet$} $93_{16}$ into binary: $10010011_2$
\medskip

Follow-up question: why is hexadecimal considered a "shorthand" notation for binary numbers?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are many references from which students may learn to perform these conversions.  You assistance should be minimal, as these procedures are simple to comprehend and easy to find.
