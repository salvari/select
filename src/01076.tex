Spring- and weight-driven clock mechanisms always use a {\it pendulum} as an integral part of their workings.  What function does a pendulum serve in a clock?  What would a mechanical clock mechanism do if the pendulum were removed?

Describe what the electrical equivalent of a mechanical pendulum is, and what purpose it might serve in an oscillator circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The pendulum in a mechanical clock serves to regulate the frequency of the clock's ticking.  The electrical equivalent of a pendulum is a {\it tank circuit}.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to brainstorm possible applications for electrical oscillator circuits, and why frequency regulation might be an important feature.
