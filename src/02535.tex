Calculate the overall voltage gain of this cascaded amplifier circuit, where the output of one voltage amplifier feeds into the input of another:

$$\epsfbox{02535x01.eps}$$

Also, convert the voltage gains of each amplifier into units of decibels, then convert the overall voltage gain ratio into units of decibels as well.

What do you notice about the overall gain of this circuit in relation to the individual amplifier gains, compared as ratios versus compared as decibel figures?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Cascaded voltage gains expressed as ratios:

$$A_{V} = 12 \times 1 = 12$$

Cascaded voltage gains expressed a decibel figures:

$$A_{V} = 21.58 \hbox{ dB} + 0 \hbox{ dB} = 21.58 \hbox{ dB}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Besides providing practice with ratio-to-decibel conversions, the purpose of this question is for students to realize that gains multiply as ratios but add as decibels.
