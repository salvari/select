Calculate the following parameters in this circuit (be sure to specify the polarity of each voltage with respect to ground!):

$$\epsfbox{02741x01.eps}$$

$V_{TP1}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{TP2}$ =

\vskip 10pt

$I_{R_2}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{out}$ =

\underbar{file 02741}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{TP1}$ = +2.5 volts \hskip 50pt $V_{TP2}$ = +2.5 volts

\vskip 10pt

$I_{R_2}$ = 500 $\mu$A \hskip 50pt $V_{out}$ = +2 volts
