In this passive filter circuit, how will the filter's cutoff frequency be affected by changes in the load resistance?  Be as specific as you can in your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f_{cutoff}$ will increase as the load resistance decreases.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to define what "cutoff frequency" means.  There is more than one definition: one based on output voltage, and one based on output power.  When defined in terms of power, the cutoff frequency is sometimes described as $f_{-3 dB}$.
