%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "polarized" power plug is one that is designed to plug into a power receptacle one way only (i.e. it cannot be reversed).  Usually this is accomplished by the use of one "prong" on the plug being wider than the other, with matching-width holes in the receptacle.

Discuss with your students the relative merits of polarized plugs versus three-wire plugs that provide a hard ground connection with the frame of the electrical device.  Which plug type provides a greater level of safety?  Why?
