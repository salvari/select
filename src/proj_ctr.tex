Your project is to design and build a single-digit (decimal) counter that counts some kind of physical event (switch closure, passing objects, etc.).  Your counter needs to have a reset switch to set it back to zero on demand.  At minimum, you must built it using a separate counter IC, BCD-to-7-segment decoder/driver IC, and a 7 segment display.  Here is a general schematic diagram for you to follow when designing your system:

Please note that this is only a general schematic, and that the details will vary according to the particular chips you happen to choose.  For example, the counter may be positive edge-triggered or negative edge-triggered; its reset may be active-high or active-low; if it is a binary counter (not BCD), you will have to add at least one logic gate to truncate its count from 0-F (hex) to 0-9 (BCD); the display driver may require common-anode or common-cathode displays; etc.

I encourage creativity when choosing the type of input switch and physical event to count.  Ideas include:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Sound-activated switch (one count per hand-clap or other loud burst of sound).
\item{$\bullet$} Optical switch to count people passing through a doorway.
\item{$\bullet$} Frequency divider to count seconds based on power line frequency (i.e. simple clock).
