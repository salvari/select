A "boost" switching converter operating at 80\% efficiency delivers 178 volts at 1 amp to a DC load.  Calculate the input voltage if the input current is 11 amps.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{input}$ = 20.2 volts

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Calculations involving energy efficiency seem very confusing to some students.  One principle that I often remind my students of is the Law of Energy Conservation, which prohibits any circuit from outputting more energy (or power) than it takes in.  All too often, students mis-calculate in problems such as these, ending up with output powers greater than input powers!  

Discuss problem-solving techniques, soliciting input from your students.  Ideally, have individuals or groups present their techniques to the class as a whole, so you may observe their thinking processes and so that other students may learn how to become better problem-solvers.
