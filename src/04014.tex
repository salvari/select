Explain the operating principle of this analog-to-digital converter circuit, usually referred to as a {\it tracking} converter:

$$\epsfbox{04014x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 04014}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The binary counter will count up or down as necessary to "track" the analog input voltage, resulting in a binary output that continuously represents the input.

Follow-up question: this form of ADC is not very effective at following fast-changing input signals.  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students express the answer to this question in their own words, not just copying the answer I provide.  Aside from the flash converter, the tracking converter is one of the easiest ADC circuits to understand.
