Determine whether the load is energized or de-energized with the switch in the position shown.  Also, identify whether the transistor is a {\it depletion} type or an {\it enhancement} type:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The load will be {\it de-energized} as a result of this {\it depletion-type} transistor being in the "off" state.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how they figured out the state of the transistor in this circuit, and also what function the double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) switch performs.  Incidentally, this DPDT switch wiring configuration is quite common in electrical and electronic circuits!
