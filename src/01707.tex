Evaluate the following arithmetic expressions, expressing the answers in expanded form:

$$3.6 \times 10^2 = $$

$$1.53 \times 10^{-4} = $$

$$8.2 \times 10^{1} = $$

$$6 \times 10^{-3} = $$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$3.6 \times 10^2 = 360$$

$$1.53 \times 10^{-4} = 0.000153$$

$$8.2 \times 10^{1} = 82$$

$$6 \times 10^{-3} = 0.006$$

The effect that multiplication by a power of ten has on a number's written expression should be obvious: the decimal point gets shifted.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The fact that multiplication by powers of ten simply shifts the decimal point is not a coincidence.  Rather, it is a logical consequence of using a {\it base-10} numeration system.  If we all used binary for our daily enumeration, we would be using "powers of two" for scientific notation!
