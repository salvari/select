While the "Branch Current" method may be used to analyze an unbalanced bridge circuit, it requires a lot of calculation!  In this circuit, determine how many variables are needed to solve for all currents:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Six variables are required to account for all unique values of current in this circuit ($I_1$ through $I_6$).

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: draw arrows in this circuit depicting these six currents, and write one KCL equation for each node.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain why it is difficult to solve for the currents in a circuit like this using the "Branch Current" method.  How many equations would be necessary to solve for the values of six variables?
