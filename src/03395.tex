Calculate the resistance value necessary for $R_4$ to make the voltmeter in this circuit register exactly zero volts:

$$\epsfbox{03395x01.eps}$$

Also, write an equation solving for $R_4$ in terms of all the other resistor values in this circuit ($R_1$ through $R_3$).  Hint: the battery voltage ($V_{total}$) need not appear in this equation at all!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_4$ = 8.46 k$\Omega$

$$R_4 = {{R_2 R_3} \over R_1}$$
