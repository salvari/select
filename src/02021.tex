%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I will let you research the procedure for determining Th\'evenin equivalent circuits, and explain it in your own words.  Here is the equivalent circuit for the circuit given in the question:

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be easy for your students to research an algorithm (step-by-step procedure) for determining a Th\'evenin equivalent circuit.  Let them do the work, and explain it to you and their classmates!
