Predict how the voltage polarity between test points {\bf A} and {\bf B} will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03944x01.eps}$$

\item{$\bullet$} Photoresistor $R_4$ fails open:

\item{$\bullet$} Photoresistor $R_3$ fails open:

\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across photoresistor $R_4$:

\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:

\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
