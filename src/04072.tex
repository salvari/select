A 470 $\mu$F capacitor begins in a charged state of 270 volts, and discharges through a 100 k$\Omega$ resistor.  How long will it take before the capacitor's voltage will fall to a relatively safe value (30 volts or less)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

It will take 103.3 seconds for the voltage to fall to 30 volts.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question incorporates electrical safety into an RC circuit time calculation.  Safety is something you should periodically revisit with your students, because it is so important.  Ask your students how a "safe" value of voltage may be determined, and if there are any environmental circumstances impacting this determination.
