Write the equation relating electric current and magnetic field strength together in a wire coil.  If the current ($I$) is given in units of amperes, and the number of turns is a simple integer value, what unit of measurement will the magnetic field strength have?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$${\cal F} = IN$$

\noindent
Where,

${\cal F} =$ Magnetomotive force (magnetic field strength), in amp-turns

$I =$ Current in wire coil, amps

$N =$ Number of turns in coil

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Sometimes, units of measurement make perfect sense!  In this case, the unit of the amp-turn follows obviously from the construction of the equation, with amps times turns.
