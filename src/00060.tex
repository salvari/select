Resistors are sometimes represented in electrical and electronic schematic diagrams by a symbol other than this:

$$\epsfbox{00060x01.eps}$$

Draw this other symbol next to the one shown above.

\underbar{file 00060}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{00060x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It might be a good idea to occasionally draw schematic diagrams for your students using the "other" resistor symbol, just so they are not taken by surprise when they see this symbol in real schematics.  Just be sure to remain consistent in your symbolism within each diagram: never mix the two different symbols within the same schematic!
