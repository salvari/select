%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A {\it leading} power factor is one created by a predominantly capacitive load, whereas a {\it lagging} power factor is one created by a predominantly inductive load.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain the phase relationships between voltage and current for each of these two conditions: a circuit with a "leading" power factor, and a circuit with a "lagging" power factor.  The terms may make a lot more sense once these relationships are seen.
