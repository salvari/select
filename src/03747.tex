What causes harmonics to form in the output of a transistor oscillator circuit such as a Colpitts or a Hartley, which is designed to produce a sinusoidal signal?  Be as specific as you can in your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Any feature (or fault) of the amplifier portion of the oscillator circuit causing imperfect signal reproduction will necessarily create harmonics, for it will turn a perfectly sinusoidal input signal (from the LC network) into a distorted (non-perfect-sinusoidal) output signal.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: Colpitts oscillators tend to produce "purer" sine-wave outputs than Hartley oscillators, all other factors being equal.  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the nature of harmonics: how {\it multiple} sinusoidal waveforms are necessarily contained in any periodic waveform that is not perfectly sinusoidal itself.
