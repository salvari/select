Calculate the load current and load voltage in this transformer circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02210x01.eps}$$

$I_{load}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{load}$ =

\vskip 10pt

\underbar{file 02210}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{load}$ = 23.77 mA \hskip 80pt $V_{load}$ = 8.318 V

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Most transformer problems are nothing more than ratios, but some students find ratios difficult to handle.  Questions such as this are great for having students come up to the board in the front of the classroom and demonstrating how they obtained the results.
