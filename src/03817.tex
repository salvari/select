A common three-phase source connection scheme is the {\it Delta high-leg} or {\it Four-wire Delta}, where each phase coil outputs 240 volts:

$$\epsfbox{03817x01.eps}$$

Identify the different voltages obtained from this coil configuration, and which connection points each voltage is measured between.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{AB}$ = 240 volts \hskip 80pt $V_{BC}$ = 240 volts \hskip 80pt $V_{AC}$ = 240 volts

\vskip 10pt

$V_{AN}$ = 120 volts \hskip 80pt $V_{BN}$ = 208 volts \hskip 80pt$V_{CN}$ = 120 volts

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The usefulness of this connection scheme should be clearly evident: three different voltage levels may be accessed for use in powering circuits.  Usually, the coils shown are secondary windings of three different transformers, the primary windings connected to a set of three-phase high voltage power lines.  In many cases, a heavier-duty transformer is used for coil {\bf AC} than for coils {\bf AB} or {\bf BC} due to the number of 120 volt loads.
