Specify values for voltage source $V_1$ and resistor $R_1$ to set the load current at a constant 11 mA in this circuit.  Assume that the operational amplifier's power supply rails are set at +15 volts and -15 volts, respectively:

$$\epsfbox{02742x01.eps}$$

$V_1$ = \hskip 80pt $R_1$ =

\underbar{file 02742}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Whatever values are specified, $V_1 \over R_1$ should equal 11 mA, and $V_1$ should be within the range of +15 to -15 volts (the power supply rails).
