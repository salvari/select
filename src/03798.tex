Predict how the operation of this relaxation oscillator circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03798x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_1$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_2$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it Opamp output saturates either positive or negative.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_1$: {\it Output voltage settles to 0 volts.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted: {\it Opamp output saturates either positive or negative.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_2$: {\it Output voltage settles to 0 volts.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open: {\it Output voltage settles to 0 volts.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
