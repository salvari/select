In this rectifier circuit, the output voltage is less than half of the secondary winding's rated voltage (12 volts).  Why is this?

$$\epsfbox{00783x01.eps}$$

Also, determine whether this is a {\it half-wave} or a {\it full-wave} rectifier circuit, and explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Only one-half of the secondary winding powers the load at any given time.

\vskip 10pt

This is a full-wave rectifier circuit.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what would have to change in this circuit to make it a half-wave rectifier?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If this question is confusing to some students, take time to discuss the directions of all currents in the circuit through both halves of the AC cycle.  Then, the answer should be apparent.
