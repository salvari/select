Assume that the comparator in this circuit is only capable of "swinging" its output to within 1 volt of its power supply rail voltages.  Calculate the upper and lower threshold voltages, given the resistor values shown:

$$\epsfbox{01170x01.eps}$$

$V_{UT}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{LT}$ = 

\vskip 10pt

\underbar{file 01170}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{UT} =$ +10.29 volts

\vskip 10pt

$V_{LT} =$ -10.29 volts

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: how would you recommend we change the circuit so that its threshold voltages are centered around some voltage value other than zero?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

As many opamps and comparators are incapable of rail-to-rail output swings, this question is quite realistic.
