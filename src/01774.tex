What will happen to each resistor's voltage and current in this circuit if resistor R2 fails shorted?  Provide individual answers for each resistor, please.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If resistor R2 fails shorted . . .

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{R2}$ will decrease to zero, $I_{R2}$ will increase
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{R1}$ will increase to full supply voltage, $I_{R1}$ will increase
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{R3}$ will decrease to zero, $I_{R3}$ will decrease to zero
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{R4}$ will decrease to zero, $I_{R4}$ will decrease to zero
\medskip

Follow-up question: note the order in which I list the qualitative effects of R2's shorted failure.  Reading from the top of the list to the bottom reveals the sequence of my reasoning.  Explain why I would come to the conclusions I did, in the order I did.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I have found in teaching that many students loathe qualitative analysis, because they cannot let their calculators do the thinking for them.  However, being able to judge whether a circuit parameter will increase, decrease, or remain the same after a component fault is an {\it essential} skill for proficient troubleshooting.
