Contrast {\it class-A}, {\it class-B}, and {\it class-C} amplifier operations, explaining what defines each class.  Then, rank these three classes in order of least power efficiency to greatest power efficiency.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you research what the definition of each "class" of amplifier operation is!  These definitions are fairly easy to find, so you should not experience much difficulty.

Class-A is least efficient, followed by class-B, and then class-C which is most power efficient.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students are liable to wonder why class-C operation is not the most popular in electronic circuits, since it is the most power-efficient of the three classes.  Discuss the limitations of class-C operation, specifically in terms of waveform distortion.
