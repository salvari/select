Intercom systems allow two people to talk across long distances over a pair of speakers, each speaker alternately serving as a microphone as well.  The following schematic diagram shows a suggested intercom circuit that works well using standard dynamic (electromagnetic) speakers, using a double-pole, double-throw switch to control the direction of communication:

The complete absence of biasing on the power transistors keeps them well away from class AB operation where they would dissipate substantial heat and consume more quiescent power, yet the audio quality is fine for speech.  The transformer ($T_1$) is just a step-down power unit taken from a wall-plug AC/DC power supply or the power supply from a small electronic appliance such as a clock radio.  A ratio of about 120 to 6 seems to work well.  This helps match the speaker's low impedance to the opamp's high impedance, while maintaining low impedance on the "microphone" side for maximum rejection of electrical interference.

I have used power supply voltages of 9 volts (+V = +4.5 volts ; -V = -4.5 volts), 12 volts (+V = +6 volts; -V = -6 volts), and 18 volts (+V = +9 volts; -V = -9 volts), all with good success.  Of course, you are not restricted to using this exact design -- feel free to modify it!
