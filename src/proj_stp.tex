Your project is to design and build a stepper motor drive circuit based on a shift register.  The basic principle will be to use a shift register to load the binary number {\tt 0001} in parallel mode once at power-up, then continually shift that number around in serial mode to the beat of a clock pulse signal.  The output lines of the shift register will then drive the four respective coils of the stepper motor:

Many details have been omitted from this schematic, but it should be enough to give you the general idea of how a stepper motor can be driven by a shift register IC.  For extra challenge, design your circuit to be able to move the stepper motor either direction.
