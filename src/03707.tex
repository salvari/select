Predict how all component voltages and currents in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03707x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ secondary winding fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Load fails shorted:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open: {\it No current through any component, no voltage across any secondary-side component.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails shorted: {\it Large current through fuse (which will cause it to blow), little current through secondary winding or load, little voltage across secondary winding or load.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ secondary winding fails open: {\it No current through any secondary-side component, no voltage across any secondary-winding component, little current through primary winding.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Load fails shorted: {\it Large current through fuse (which will cause it to blow), large current through secondary winding and load, little voltage across secondary winding or load.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
