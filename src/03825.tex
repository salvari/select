Identify at least three different transistor faults in this CMOS logic gate that could cause the output to fail {\it low}:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ failed shorted (drain to source).
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_4$ failed open (drain to source).
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_5$ failed open (drain to source).
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_{10}$ failed shorted (drain to source).
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One way for students to approach this problem is to re-draw the schematic in gate symbol form, a NAND gate followed by three inverters:

$$\epsfbox{03825x02.eps}$$

Discuss with them why this approach may be helpful in determining possible component faults in the integrated circuit.
