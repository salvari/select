Two construction workers, standing on the roof of a building, hoist identical buckets of tools to the top by pulling upward on long ropes.  The weight of the tools and buckets are the same for each worker, as is the distance each bucket is hoisted.  However, one worker hoists their bucket from the ground to the roof in one-third the time that it takes the other worker.  Compare the efforts of the two workers in terms of {\it energy} and {\it power}.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Both workers perform the same amount of {\it work}, and expend the same amount of {\it energy} in doing so.  However, the worker who hoists the bucket up in only one-third the time performed that work with three times as much {\it power} as the slower worker.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is a common misconception to equate {\it energy} with {\it power}.  Energy, technically, is a measure that is irrespective of time.  Power, on the other hand, implicitly references the time taken to do a certain amount of work.
