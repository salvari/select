Suppose an induction motor were built to run on single-phase AC power rather than polyphase AC power.  Instead of multiple sets of windings, it only has one set of windings:

$$\epsfbox{00743x01.eps}$$

Which way would the rotor start to spin as power is applied?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The rotor would not spin at all -- it would merely vibrate.  However, if you mechanically forced the rotor to spin in one direction, it would keep going that direction, speeding up until it reached full speed.

Follow-up question: what does this tell us about the behavior of single-phase induction motors that is fundamentally different from polyphase induction motors?

Challenge question: what does this tell us about the effects of an open line conductor on a three-phase induction motor?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a "trick" question, in that the student is asked to determine which direction the rotor will start to spin, when in fact it has no "preferred" direction of rotation.  An excellent means of demonstrating this effect is to take a regular single-phase motor and disconnect its start switch so that it is electrically identical to the motor shown in the question, then connect it to an AC power source.  It will not spin until you give the shaft a twist with your hand.  But be careful: once it starts to turn, it ramps up to full speed quickly!

The real purpose of this question is to get students to recognize the main "handicap" of a single-phase AC motor, and to understand what is required to overcome that limitation.  The challenge question essentially asks students what happens to a three-phase motor that is suddenly forced to operate as a single-phase motor due to a line failure.  Incidentally, this is called {\it single-phasing} of the motor, and it is not good!
