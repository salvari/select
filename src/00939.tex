What is {\it common-mode voltage}, and how should a differential amplifier (ideally) respond to it?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Common-mode voltage" is the amount of voltage common to both inputs of a differential amplifier.  Ideally, a differential amplifier should {\it reject} this common-mode voltage, only amplifying the difference between the two input voltages.

Follow-up question: what does the phrase {\it common-mode rejection ratio} (CMRR) mean for a differential amplifier?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to provide examples of common-mode voltage to a differential amplifier.  For example, $x$ amount of voltage on one input and $y$ amount of voltage on the other constitutes $z$ amount of common-mode voltage . . .
