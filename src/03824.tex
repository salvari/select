Predict how the operation of this logic gate circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03824x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails open (drain to source):
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_2$ fails open (drain to source):
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open: {\it No effect.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails shorted: {\it Output always in low state, possible damage to circuit when input is forced low by another gate (or switch).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails open: {\it No effect.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_2$ fails shorted: {\it Output always in high state, possible damage to circuit when input is forced high by another gate (or switch).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_1$ fails open (drain to source): {\it Output cannot source current in high state, but is still able to sink current in low state.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_2$ fails open (drain to source): {\it Output cannot sink current in low state, but is still able to source current in high state.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
