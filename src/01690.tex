%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source.  Specify standard resistor, capacitor, and inductor values.  I have used a small 100 mH inductor, a 0.033 $\mu$F capacitor, and 100 $\Omega$ resistor with good success.  In any case I recommend keeping the resonant frequency within the mid-audio range (1 kHz to 10 kHz) to avoid problems with low inductor $Q$ (frequency too low) and stray capacitance and inductance issues (frequency too high).
