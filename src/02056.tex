Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are considered "normally-off" devices, because their natural state with no signal applied to the base is no conduction between emitter and collector, like an open switch.  Are junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) considered the same?  Why or why not?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

JFETs are "normally-on" devices.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to elaborate on the answer given.  Do not accept a mindless recitation of the answer, "JFETs are normally-on devices," but rather demand that some sort of explanation be given as to {\it why} JFETs are normally-on devices.
