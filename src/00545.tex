Identify the most important qualification for the "null" meter used to balance a bridge circuit.  In other words, describe what type of meter we would be looking for if we were to select one for use as a "null" meter.  Describe why this particular quality is important.

Above all, a null meter must be {\it sensitive}.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the definition of "sensitivity" with regard to meter movements, and why null meters have to be sensitive in order for the bridge circuit to be accurately balanced.  If your students have studied meter movement design, you may wish to challenge them with a question on exactly how a null meter movement might be constructed (i.e. what would have to be done to maximize its sensitivity?).
