A student with nothing better to do decides to build this monster of a circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02723x01.eps}$$

Calculate the overall voltage gain of this circuit, both as a ratio and as a figure in units of decibels.

\vskip 10pt

$A_{V(ratio)}$ = \hskip 80pt $A_{V(dB)}$ =

\underbar{file 02723}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$A_{V(ratio)}$ = 0.333 \hskip 30pt $A_{V(dB)}$ = -9.542 dB
