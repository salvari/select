Complete the timing diagram, showing the state of the $Q$ output over time as the input switches are actuated.  Assume that $Q$ begins in the low state on power-up:

$$\epsfbox{02913x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students explain exactly how they arrived at the solution they did for the output waveform.  Are they making use of a truth table for the S-R latch to figure out what happens?  Are they doing it by memory?  Can they discriminate between an output state change initiated by either the Set or Reset inputs versus one initiated by the enable going high?
