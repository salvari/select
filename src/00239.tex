%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Wire nuts" are electrical fasteners which use a coiled spring to clasp bare metal wire ends together.  The "nut" is screwed on to the ends of two or more wires to be joined, as though it were a nut being threaded onto a bolt.  The coils of the spring inside the nut function as threads, which grip the wire ends tighter as the nut is turned clockwise over them.

It would be good to have several sizes of wire nuts available in the classroom for your students to see and touch during discussion.
