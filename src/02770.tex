The voltage gain of an inverting operational amplifier circuit is defined by the ratio of feedback to input resistance:

$$A_V = {R_f \over R_i}$$

$$\epsfbox{02770x02.eps}$$

Calculate the necessary values of $R_1$ and $R_2$ to limit the minimum and maximum voltage gain of this opamp circuit to 5 and 30, respectively, given a potentiometer in the middle with a full-span resistance of 5 k$\Omega$:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1$ = 1.2 k$\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$R_2$ = 31 k$\Omega$
