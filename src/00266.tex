Determine whether or not the following resistors measure within the resistance range specified by their color codes:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} (Org, Org, Red, Blk, Blu) Measured resistance = 332.5 $\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} (Brn, Blk, Blk, Gld, Red) Measured resistance = 9.7 $\Omega$ 
\item{$\bullet$} (Blu, Vio, Brn, Red, Grn) Measured resistance = 67.43 k$\Omega$ 
\item{$\bullet$} (Red, Wht, Grn, Yel, Vio) Measured resistance = 2.949 M$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} (Yel, Vio, Org, Gld) Measured resistance = 44.68 k$\Omega$ 
\item{$\bullet$} (Gry, Red, Brn, Sil) Measured resistance = 905 $\Omega$ 
\item{$\bullet$} (Grn, Blu, Gld) Measured resistance = 6.73 $\Omega$ 
\item{$\bullet$} (Vio, Brn, Red, Gld, Brn) Measured resistance = 70.82 $\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} (Wht, Org, Blu, Brn, Grn) Measured resistance = 9.38 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} (Red, Blk, Wht, Grn, Vio) Measured resistance = 20.86 M$\Omega$ 
\medskip

Assume that all five-band resistors listed here use the {\it precision} color code as opposed to the military 5-band code where the fifth band indicates resistor reliability.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} (Org, Org, Red, Blk, Blu) Measured resistance = 332.5 $\Omega$ {\it Within tolerance}
\item{$\bullet$} (Brn, Blk, Blk, Gld, Red) Measured resistance = 9.7 $\Omega$ {\bf Out of tolerance!}
\item{$\bullet$} (Blu, Vio, Brn, Red, Grn) Measured resistance = 67.43 k$\Omega$ {\it Within tolerance}
\item{$\bullet$} (Red, Wht, Grn, Yel, Vio) Measured resistance = 2.949 M$\Omega$ {\it Within tolerance}
\item{$\bullet$} (Yel, Vio, Org, Gld) Measured resistance = 44.68 k$\Omega$ {\it Within tolerance} 
\item{$\bullet$} (Gry, Red, Brn, Sil) Measured resistance = 905 $\Omega$ {\bf Out of tolerance!}
\item{$\bullet$} (Grn, Blu, Gld) Measured resistance = 6.73 $\Omega$ {\bf Out of tolerance!}
\item{$\bullet$} (Vio, Brn, Red, Gld, Brn) Measured resistance = 70.82 $\Omega$ {\it Within tolerance}
\item{$\bullet$} (Wht, Org, Blu, Brn, Grn) Measured resistance = 9.38 k$\Omega$ {\it Within tolerance}
\item{$\bullet$} (Red, Blk, Wht, Grn, Vio) Measured resistance = 20.86 M$\Omega$ {\bf Out of tolerance!}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question serves as a great review for the mathematical concepts of scientific notation and percentages.  They will have to calculate the allowable range of resistance values for each resistor in order to determine whether or not the measured value falls within that range.
