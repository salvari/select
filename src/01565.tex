Calculate the resonant frequency, bandwidth, and half-power points of the following filter circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01565x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01565}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f_r = 6.79 \hbox{ kHz}$

\vskip 5pt

Bandwidth = 289.4 Hz

\vskip 5pt

$f_1 = 6.64 \hbox{ kHz}$

\vskip 5pt

$f_2 = 6.93 \hbox{ kHz}$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: how would a decrease in the $Q$ ("quality factor") of the circuit affect the bandwidth, or would it at all?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)
 
The formulae required to calculate these parameters are easily obtained from any basic electronics text.  No student should have trouble finding this information.

%INDEX% Bandwidth, band-pass filter circuit
%INDEX% Quality factor (Q), effect on bandwidth of filter circuit
