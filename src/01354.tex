The circuit shown here is a {\it gated} S-R latch.  Write the truth table for this latch circuit, and explain the function of the "Enable" (E) input:

$$\epsfbox{01354x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01354}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

When the Enable input is low (0), the circuit ignores the Set and Reset inputs:

$$\epsfbox{01354x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Just one more level of gating added to an S-R latch circuit!
