Suppose you needed to boost the power output of your signal generator to 10 watts.  This is substantially more than what the integrated circuit is capable of delivering unassisted.  What else would you have to add to your circuit in order to obtain this level of power output?  What difference(s) will it make to your design if you only intend to operate at audio frequencies, versus if you intend to sweep from audio frequencies all the way up to IF or even RF?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Obviously, you will need some form of amplifier to "follow up" the signal generator IC.  The real question is, what type of amplifier?  There are many factors to consider here!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students will have to consider several different factors when choosing an appropriate amplifier for the task, bandwidth being just one of them.  Adding an amplifier stage to the signal generator circuit is a very appropriate design objective to include in this project, by the way!
