Convert this series-parallel combination circuit into an equivalent simple-parallel circuit (all components connected in parallel with each other, with nothing in series), and also calculate the circuit's total impedance:

$Z_{total} =$ 963.0 $\Omega$

Challenge question: from the simple-parallel equivalent circuit shown here, can you generate an equivalent circuit that is simple-series?  In other words, can you calculate the proper values of $R$ and $L$, that when connected in series, will have the same total impedance as this circuit?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Fundamentally, this question asks students to generate an equivalent parallel R-X circuit from a given series R-X circuit.  In this particular circuit, there are two series-connected R-X branches, resulting in an equivalent parallel circuit with four branches.

Calculating the circuit's total impedance as a scalar figure involves simplifying the circuit once more into two components: a resistance and a reactance.
