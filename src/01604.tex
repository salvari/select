%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts.  Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k$\Omega$ and 100 k$\Omega$ (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 8k2, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, 82k, etc.).

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
