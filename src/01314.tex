Complete truth tables for the following gates, and also write the Boolean expression for each gate:

$$\epsfbox{01314x01.eps}$$

The results should be obvious once the truth tables are both complete.  Is there a general principle at work here?  Do you think we would obtain similar results with Negative-OR and NAND gates?  Explain.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01314x02.eps}$$

Negative-AND gate: $\overline{A} \> \overline{B}$

\vskip 10pt

NOR gate: $\overline{A + B}$
