In this circuit, a solar cell converts light into voltage for the opamp to "read" on its noninverting input.  The opamp's inverting input connects to the wiper of a potentiometer.  Under what conditions does the LED energize?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The LED energizes under bright-light conditions, de-energizing when the light decreases below the threshold set by the potentiometer.

Follow-up question: determine what would have to be changed in this circuit to make the LED turn on when the solar cell becomes {\it dark}.
