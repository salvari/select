Calculate the phase angle of the current drawn from the AC signal source as it drives the passive integrator circuit on the left, and the active integrator circuit on the right.  In both cases, assume that nothing is connected to the $V_{out}$ terminal:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$\Theta$ = 46.7$^{o}$ for the passive integrator current, while $\Theta$ = 0$^{o}$ for the active integrator circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The most important thing to be learned here is that the opamp "isolates" the signal source from whatever impedance is in the feedback loop, so that the input impedance (in this case, the 10 k$\Omega$ resistor) is the only impedance "visible" to that source.  This has profound effects on the phase relationship between the output signal and the input signal.
