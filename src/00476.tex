Suppose this circuit was found to output a voltage of 11.0 volts, given the input voltages shown:

$$\epsfbox{00476x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{} $V_1 =$ 8.5 volts
\item{} $V_2 =$ 10.0 volts
\item{} $V_3 =$ 12.0 volts
\medskip

What do suspect is wrong with this circuit?  How would you verify the cause of the incorrect output voltage?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The upper resistor is failed open.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note how even with a failed resistor, the circuit still performs the proper mathematical function (albeit, only regarding two of the input "channels" rather than three).  Ask your students how they determined the source of the problem, and how they would verify that as being the fault, with just a single meter measurement.
