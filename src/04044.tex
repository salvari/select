Identify what type of filter this circuit is, calculate its cutoff frequency, and distinguish the input terminal from the output terminal:

$$\epsfbox{04044x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 04044}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it low-pass} filter.

\vskip 10pt

$f_{cutoff}$ = 48.23 Hz

\vskip 10pt

The input terminal is on the right, while the output terminal is on the left.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to ask students where they found the cutoff frequency formula for this filter circuit.  Also, ask them how they were able to distinguish the input and output terminals.  What would happen if these terminals were reversed (i.e. if the input signal were applied to the output terminal)?
