Determine the amount of current from point {\bf A} to point {\bf B} in this circuit, and also the output voltage of the operational amplifier:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I$ = 6.5 mA \hskip 50pt $V_{out}$ = -6.5 V

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is best preceded by \#02516, which asks for students to solve for the current between {\bf A} and {\bf B} with no opamp in the circuit (simply grounded at point {\bf B}).  When students realize that point {\bf B} is now a {\it virtual} ground instead of a real ground, they see that the same conclusion derived by Kirchhoff's Current Law in the passive circuit is still valid in this active circuit, and that the result is an output {\it voltage} corresponding to that current.
