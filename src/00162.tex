In calculating the size of wire necessary to carry alternating current to a high-power load, which type of measurement is the best to use for current: peak, average, or RMS?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

RMS current is the most appropriate type of measurement for calculating wire size.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A clue to answering this question is this: what actually happens when the ampacity rating of a conductor is exceeded?  Why, exactly, is overcurrent a bad thing for conductors in general?

It is important for students to recognize the value of RMS measurements: why do we use them, and in what applications are they the most appropriate type of measurement to use in certain calculations?  Ask your students what other applications might best use RMS voltage and current measurements as opposed to peak or average.
