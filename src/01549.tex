Explain, step by step, how to calculate the amount of current ($I$) that will go through each resistor in this series circuit, and also the voltage ($V$) dropped by each resistor:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item {} $I_{R1} = 2.22$ mA ; $V_{R1} = 3.33$ V
\item {} $I_{R2} = 2.22$ mA ; $V_{R2} = 22.2$ V
\item {} $I_{R3} = 2.22$ mA ; $V_{R3} = 10.4$ V

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students often just want to memorize a procedure for determining answers to questions like these.  Challenge your students to not only understand the procedure, but to also explain {\it why} it must be followed.

Something your students will come to realize in discussion is that there is more than one way to arrive at all the answers!  While some of the steps will be common to all calculation strategies, other steps (near the end) leave room for creativity.

Note to your students that European symbols are used throughout this schematic diagram.
