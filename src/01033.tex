Photodiodes, phototransistors, and light-emitting diodes all play important roles in {\it optical communications networks}, where digital (on/off) signals are communicated over long distances as pulses of light energy rather than voltage or current.

Why are LEDs greatly preferred over other electro-optical devices such as incandescent lamps or gas-discharge bulbs?  What can an LED do that a small electric lamp cannot?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Semiconductor-based light emitting devices are capable of turning on and off much, much faster than incandescent or gas-discharge devices.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In digital communications networks, speed is an essential quality.  Ask your students why this is so, and by association, why semiconductor-based light sources are almost exclusively used in optical networks.
