When the vertical ("Y") axis of an oscilloscope is shorted, the result should be a straight line in the middle of the screen:

$$\epsfbox{00531x01.eps}$$

Determine the DC polarity of the voltage source, based on this illustration:

$$\epsfbox{00531x02.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{00531x03.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question challenges students to figure out both the polarization of the probe (and ground clip), as well as the orientation of the Y axis.  It is very important, of course, that the coupling control be set on "DC" in order to successfully measure a DC signal.
