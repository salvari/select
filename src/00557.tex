%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Tinning" is the act of pre-soldering the bare wire end, so that its appearance is like solder instead of copper.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some wire may be purchase "pre-tinned" to save you this step, but most electrical wire is not.  Here is a helpful hint: tinning the ends of a piece of stranded copper wire really helps to prevent individual strands from bending and breaking away when the wire end is clamped in a terminal strip!
