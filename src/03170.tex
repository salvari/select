Determine the necessary logic states at the select inputs of the multiplexer (A, B, and C) to cause a 93.75 Hz square wave to appear at the output.  Both of the four-bit counters shown are full-binary (modulus = 16):

$$\epsfbox{03170x01.eps}$$

$C$ = \hskip 30pt $B$ = \hskip 30pt $A$ =

\underbar{file 03170}
