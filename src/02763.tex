Crude logic gates circuits may be constructed out of nothing but diodes and resistors.  Take for example this logic gate circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02763x01.eps}$$

Identify what type of logic function is represented by this gate circuit (AND, OR, inverter, etc.).

\underbar{file 02763}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an OR gate circuit.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Diode-resistor gate circuits such as this are rarely used in real digital circuitry because they have no capacity to {\it amplify} weak input signals.  They also have no capacity for signal inversion, rendering them incapable of representing a great many logic function types.  Gates made from transistors are much preferred over diode-resistor technology.
