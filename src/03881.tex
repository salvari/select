Multi-stage amplifiers may be {\it direct-coupled}, {\it capacitor-coupled}, or {\it transformer-coupled}.  Explain why different forms of stage-to-stage coupling matters.  In other words, identify at least one reason why a designer would choose one form of coupling over the other in their amplifier circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Only {\it direct-coupled} amplifiers can pass DC signals through from the input to the output.  {\it Capacitor-} and {\it transformer-coupled} amplifiers are immune to DC bias shifts in the input signal.
