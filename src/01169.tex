Assume that the comparator in this circuit is capable of "swinging" its output fully from rail to rail.  Calculate the upper and lower threshold voltages, given the resistor values shown:

$$\epsfbox{01169x01.eps}$$

$V_{UT}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{LT}$ = 

\vskip 10pt

\underbar{file 01169}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{UT} =$ +8 volts

\vskip 10pt

$V_{LT} =$ -8 volts

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: how would you recommend we change the circuit to give threshold voltages of +6 volts and -6 volts, respectively?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain what the terms "upper threshold" and "lower threshold" mean with regard to input voltage in a circuit such as this.
