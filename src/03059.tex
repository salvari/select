Many different equations used in the analysis of electric circuits may be graphed.  Take for instance Ohm's Law for a 1 k$\Omega$ resistor:

$$\epsfbox{03059x01.eps}$$

Plot this graph, following Ohm's Law.  Then, plot another graph representing the voltage/current relationship of a 2 k$\Omega$ resistor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how they plotted the two functions.  Did they make a table of values first?  Did they draw dots on the paper and then connect those dots with a line?  Did anyone plot dots for the endpoints and then draw a straight line in between because they knew this was a linear function?
