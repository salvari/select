Re-draw the circuit shown here into schematic form, and solve for the voltage drops across the two resistors using the "Branch Current" method:

$$\epsfbox{01049x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01049x02.eps}$$

$E_{2200 \Omega} =$ 5.713 V

\vskip 10pt

$E_{4700 \Omega} =$ 11.89 V

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to spend time with your students comparing their different solution strategies.  With there being so many combinations of ways to draw branch currents and write equations, it is highly unlikely that all students' work will be identical.  The important lesson here is that different variations still lead to the same (correct) results.
