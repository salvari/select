Describe what the output voltage of this transistor circuit will do (measured with reference to ground), if the potentiometer wiper begins at the full-down position (common with ground), and is slowly moved in the {\it upward} direction (closer to +V):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out}$ will decrease, from +10 volts to nearly zero volts, as the potentiometer wiper is moved closer to +V.

Follow-up question: based on this result, would you be inclined to call this amplifier an {\it inverting} or a {\it noninverting} circuit?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although this circuit is very simple, it is also very important to master.  Be sure to discuss its operation thoroughly with your students, so they understand.
