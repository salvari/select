Suppose this microphone amplifier circuit used to function fine, but now has stopped outputting any sound at all:

$$\epsfbox{03743x01.eps}$$

Initial diagnostic measurements show all quiescent (DC) voltages to be normal.  From this data, where would you suspect the problem is, and where would you suspect the problem is {\it not}?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The problem is {\it not} in any of the four resistors, or the transistor.  The most likely components to suspect at this point would be the microphone, capacitors, transformer, and/or speaker.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why the normal DC voltage measurements indicate healthy resistors and transistor.  How can we quickly eliminate those components as being faulty based on simple DC voltage measurements?
