Your project is to design and build a power inverter to convert 12 volts DC to 120 volts AC.  A suggested circuit is shown here:

% Sample schematic diagram here
$$\epsfbox{proj_inv.eps}$$

Please note that this is only a general schematic, and may not be exactly what you need to build in order to have a successful inverter circuit.  Your choice of specific power components (transformer, power MOSFETs, zener diodes) are critical.  Paralleled MOSFETs and zener diodes may very well be in order!
