Determine the current through battery \#2 in this power system, if the generator is outputting 50 amps, battery \#1 is charging at a rate of 22 amps, and the light bulbs draw 5 amps of current each.  Be sure to indicate whether battery \#2 is charging or discharging:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Battery \#2 is charging at a rate of 13 amps.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Perhaps the most difficult portion of this question for students to figure out is which way current goes when a battery is charging, versus when it is discharging.  Thus, it is a good review for students on secondary battery theory!

Another challenge for students might be where to label a "node" for the algebraic summation of currents.  Do not simply tell them, but rather let them choose the node.
