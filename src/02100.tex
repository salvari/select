What does it mean to {\it add} two or more phasors together, in a geometric sense?  How would one draw a phasor diagram showing the following two phasors added together?

$$\epsfbox{02100x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02100}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here are two ways of showing the same addition:

$$\epsfbox{02100x02.eps}$$

Follow-up question: how would you verbally explain the process of phasor addition?  If you were to describe to someone else how to add phasors together, what would you tell them?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students that phasors may also be subtracted, multiplied, and divided.  Subtraction is not too difficult to visualize, but addition and multiplication defies geometric understanding for many.
