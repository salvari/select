Calculate the approximate amount of AC voltage output by this common-collector amplifier circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02438x01.eps}$$

Also, explain why the reactance of each capacitor is a negligible factor in the operation of this amplifier circuit, assuming a signal frequency of 5 kHz.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you figure out the output voltage on your own!  As for the capacitive reactances, they are just over {\it 1 ohm each} at this frequency: practically a "direct connection" for the AC signal compared to the resistance values throughout the circuit.

Challenge question: calculate the approximate (average) DC voltage dropped across the 1 k$\Omega$ emitter resistor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should know the AC voltage gain of this amplifier configuration to be approximately 1, so the output voltage calculation should be trivial.  This question is really a test to see whether or not students are able to apply their knowledge of voltage gain to a specific application.
