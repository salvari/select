How much voltage does the light bulb receive in this circuit?  Explain your answer.

Also, identify the polarity of the voltage across the light bulb (mark with "+" and "-" signs).

Follow-up question: being that 30 volts is the commonly accepted "danger" threshold voltage for electric shock, determine whether or not this particular circuit poses a shock hazard.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very fundamental concept that students must learn: how to determine the total voltage in a series circuit where opposing voltage sources exist.  One thing mistake students sometimes make is to try to discern polarity by looking at the polarity signs at the end terminals of the end battery; i.e. at the 3-volt battery's left-hand terminal, and the 4.5-volt battery's right-hand terminal, then try to transfer those signs down to the load terminals.  This is {\it not} an accurate way to tell polarity, but it seems to "work" for them in some situations.  This problem is one example of a situation where this faulty technique most definitely does not work!

Have your students collectively agree on a procedure they may use to accurate discern series voltage sums and polarities.  Guide their discussion, helping them identify principles that are true and valid for all series circuits.

With regard to the safety question, there is more to determining risk of shock than a simple voltage check.  It is important for your students to realize this, despite "accepted" thresholds for hazardous voltage and such.
