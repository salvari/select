Your project is to build a "sensitive audio detector:" a device useful for detecting low-level electrical signals and expressing them in the form of sound.  Here is a sample schematic diagram for you to follow:

I recommend you follow this design closely, to ensure your detector will function in a safe manner.  The headphones should be of the "passive" type, meaning no built-in amplifier or sound controls -- just a plain set of 8 $\Omega$ closed-cup headphones.  If you wish to make any design changes, please consult your instructor.
