Predict how the operation of this summer circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03780x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_3$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_4$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_5$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_5$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_6$ fails open:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ becomes equal to ${4 \over 3}$ the sum of voltages $V_2$, $V_3$, and $V_4$.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_3$: {\it $V_{out}$ becomes equal to 4 times $V_3$.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_4$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ becomes equal to ${4 \over 3}$ the sum of voltages $V_1$, $V_2$, and $V_3$.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_5$ fails open: {\it Circuit operates as an averager, not a summer.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) across resistor $R_5$: {\it $V_{out}$ saturates in a positive direction.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_6$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ saturates in a positive direction.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
