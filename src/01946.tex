%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this exercise is to get students to understand how AC signals are mixed with DC voltages ("biased") and also how these DC bias voltages are removed to leave just an AC signal.  This is important to understand for the purpose of analyzing BJT amplifier circuits.

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts.  Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k$\Omega$ and 100 k$\Omega$ (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).  Use a sine-wave function generator to supply an audio-frequency input signal.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
