Research the resistance equivalence equations for each of these switched-capacitor networks (using N-channel MOSFETs as switches), describing the emulated resistance ($R$) as a function of switching frequency ($f$) and capacitance ($C$):

Note: $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are two-phase, non-overlapping clock signals.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Circuit {\bf A}: Parallel circuit \hskip 10pt $R = {1 \over {fC}}$

\vskip 20pt

Circuit {\bf B}: Series circuit \hskip 10pt $R = {1 \over {fC}}$ 

\vskip 20pt

Circuit {\bf C}: Series-parallel circuit \hskip 10pt $R = {1 \over {f(C_1 + C_2)}}$ 

\vskip 20pt

Circuit {\bf D}: Bilinear circuit \hskip 10pt $R = {1 \over {4fC}}$ 

\vskip 20pt

Circuit {\bf E}: Negative transresistor circuit \hskip 10pt $R = - {1 \over {fC}}$ (the negative sign indicates polarity inversion)

\vskip 20pt

Circuit {\bf F}:  Positive transresistor circuit \hskip 10pt $R = {1 \over {fC}}$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The mathematics required to derive these equations directly may be beyond your students' ability, but they should still be able to research them!  Some of the networks are directly equivalent to one another, making it easier for your students to associate equations: for instance, circuit {\bf F} is equivalent to circuit {\bf B}, and circuit {\bf E} is the same thing as {\bf F} except for the polarity inversion.  It should not take a great deal of analysis to realize that circuits {\bf A} and {\bf B} must have the same equation as well.
