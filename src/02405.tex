Compare the relative magnitudes of each current in this bipolar transistor circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02405x01.eps}$$

Which current is the smallest and which is the largest?  Are there any two currents that are closer in magnitude than with the third?  If so, which currents are they?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$I_E > I_C >> I_B$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note the brief nature of the answer.  This mathematical expression says it all, and it is a good review of inequality symbols.

%INDEX% BJT, current magnitudes
%INDEX% Current through a BJT, magnitudes of each
