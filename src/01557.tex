Using a computer or graphing calculator, plot the sum of these two sine waves:

$$\epsfbox{01557x01.eps}$$

What do you suppose the sum of a 1-volt (peak) sine wave and a 2-volt (peak) sine wave will be, if both waves are perfectly in-phase with each other?

\vskip 10pt

Hint: you will need to enter equations into your plotting device that look something like this:

\vskip 10pt

{\tt y1 = sin x}

\vskip 10pt

{\tt y2 = 2 * sin x}

\vskip 10pt

{\tt y3 = y1 + y2}

\vskip 10pt

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Graphing calculators are excellent tools to use for learning experiences such as this.  In far less time than it would take to plot a third sine wave by hand, students may see the sinusoidal sum for themselves.
