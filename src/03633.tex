There are many ways to make a resonant LC circuit "tunable" so that its resonant frequency may be varied.  One way is to provide the inductor with a movable core:

$$\epsfbox{03633x01.eps}$$

Determine which way the core needs to move ({\it up} or {\it down}) to {\it decrease} the resonant frequency of this LC circuit, and explain why this is so.  Be sure to include the concept of {\it magnetic permeability} in your explanation.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Moving the core material {\it down} (closer to the wire coil) increases the {\it magnetic permeability} of the inductor, thus increasing the magnetic flux generated for any given amount of current through the coil, thus increasing its inductance, thus decreasing the resonant frequency of the LC circuit.
