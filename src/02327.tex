Some of the following transistor switch circuits are properly configured, and some are not.  Identify which of these circuits will function properly (i.e. turn on the load when the switch closes) and which of these circuits are mis-wired:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very important concept for students to learn if they are to do any switch circuit design -- a task not limited to engineers.  Technicians often must piece together simple transistor switching circuits to accomplish specific tasks on the job, so it is important for them to be able to design switching circuits that will work.

Have your students describe to the class how they were able to determine the status of each circuit, so that everyone may learn new ways of looking at this type of problem.  Also have them describe what would have to be changed in the "bad" circuits to make them functional.
