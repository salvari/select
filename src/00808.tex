Challenge question: if a resistor were connected between the ends of this wire loop, would it "see" direct current (DC), or alternating current (AC)?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note that the two wire ends switch polarity as the loop rotates.  Ask your students to explain why the polarities are as they are.
