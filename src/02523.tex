Follow-up question: what would be required to get this circuit to output the {\it exact} sum of the four input voltages?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question not only provides practice analyzing the behavior of a summer circuit, but also analyzing the behavior of a passive averager circuit.  If your students need some refreshing on how to analyze the passive averager, you might want to review Millman's Theorem with them.
