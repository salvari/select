Suppose that an electric heater, which is nothing more than a large resistor, dissipates 500 watts of power when directly connected to a 110 volt source:

$$\epsfbox{03252x01.eps}$$

Now suppose that exact same heater is connected to one end of a long two-wire cable, which is then connected to the same 110 volt source.  Assuming that each conductor within the cable has an end-to-end resistance of 3 ohms, how much power will the heater dissipate?

The purpose of this question, besides providing a good problem-solving exercise for students, is to get them to realize one of the practical implications of power-line resistance.
