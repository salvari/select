Calculate the approximate amount of current this current mirror circuit will try to maintain through $R_{load}$, assuming silicon transistors (0.7 volts forward base-emitter junction drop):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{load} \approx$ 6.5 mA

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what would have to be changed in this circuit to increase the amount of current through the load resistor without changing the power supply voltage?
