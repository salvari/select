Draw the proper wire connections necessary for "enhancing" this MOSFET with the solar cell's voltage, so that the battery energizes the relay whenever there is sufficient light exposure on the solar cell:

Challenge question: connect a commutating ("free-wheeling") diode into the circuit shown, so that inductive "kickback" from the relay de-energizing does not harm the MOSFET.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should note that the circuit shown is not the only possible way a MOSFET could be used to turn a relay on.  Often, the substrate (SS) and source (S) terminals of the MOSFET are made common with each other, so that the controlling and controlled circuits share a common point (usually the system "ground" point).

Ask your students what would happen if the battery's polarity were reversed.
