Use the "impedance triangle" to calculate the necessary reactance of this series combination of resistance ($R$) and inductive reactance ($X$) to produce the desired total impedance of 145 $\Omega$:

$$\epsfbox{02083x01.eps}$$

Explain what equation(s) you use to calculate $X$, and the algebra necessary to achieve this result from a more common formula.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$X$ = 105 $\Omega$, as calculated by an algebraically manipulated version of the Pythagorean Theorem.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to have students show you the form of the Pythagorean Theorem, rather than showing them yourself, since it is so easy for students to research on their own.
