Suppose you need a memory array with 4k $\times$ 4 organization, but all you have on hand are 1k $\times$ 4 memory chips.  Explain how you could build a memory array of this size using multiple 1k $\times$ 4 chips.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use four memory chips: parallel the ten address lines from each 1k $\times$ 4 memory chip, then connect the $\overline{CS}$ line of each chip to the output of a 2-line to 4-line decoder.  The two decoder input lines will then become address lines $A_{10}$ and $A_{11}$ of the 4k $\times$ 4 memory array.

Although no schematic is given here in the answer, I expect my students to be able to draw one on their own.

%INDEX% Memory expansion, address
%INDEX% Address expansion, memory
