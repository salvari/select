Calculate the approximate output voltage of this regulated power supply circuit and the amount of current through the zener diode under no-load conditions:

$$\epsfbox{02440x01.eps}$$

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out} \approx$ -8.6 V \hskip 30pt $I_{zener} \approx$ 6.71 mA

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Calculating the output voltage is a much simpler task than calculating the zener diode's current!  Have your students explain their problem-solving techniques for this circuit.
