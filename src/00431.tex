Replace the fixed-value resistor with a potentiometer to adjust the blinking rate of the neon lamp, in this {\it relaxation oscillator} circuit.  Connect the potentiometer in such a way that clockwise rotation of the knob makes the lamp blink faster:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain {\it why} the potentiometer has the speed-changing effect it does on the circuit's flash rate.  Would there be any other way to change this circuit's flash rate, without using a potentiometer?
