%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$\Phi$ = 40 mWb

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing special here, just a simple calculation.  One of the points of this question is to have students research Rowland's Law and learn how to use it as they would Ohm's Law.

Note that the unit abbreviation for "webers" contains two letters, not just one as is the case for most unit abbreviations!
