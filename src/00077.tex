When lightning strikes, nearby magnetic compass needles may be seen to jerk in response to the electrical discharge.  No compass needle deflection results during the accumulation of electrostatic charge preceding the lightning bolt, but only when the bolt actually strikes.  What does this phenomenon indicate about voltage, current, and magnetism?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The presence of an electric current will produce a magnetic field, but the mere presence of a voltage will not.  For more detail on the historical background of this scientific discovery, research the work of Hans Christian Oersted in the early 1820's.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The discovery of electromagnetism was nothing short of revolutionary in Oersted's time.  It paved the way for the development of electric motors, among other useful electrical devices.
