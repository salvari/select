Suppose we had a long length of electrical {\it cable} (flexible tubing containing multiple wires) that we suspected had some broken wires in it.  Design a simple testing circuit that could be used to check each of the cable's wires individually.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A significant portion of electrical/electronic circuit problems are caused by nothing more complex than broken wire connections, or faults along the length of wires.  Testing cables for wire breaks is a very practical exercise.

The same technique may be used to "map" wires from one end of a cable to the other, in the event that the wires are not color-coded or otherwise made identifiable.
