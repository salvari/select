Given the following test circuit, with an oscilloscope used to record {\it current} from the battery to the cable (measuring voltage dropped across a shunt resistor), what sort of waveform or pulse would the oscilloscope register after switch closure?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The oscilloscope would register a continuous current of 480 mA any time the switch is closed.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students to think of another electrical component (besides an RG-58/U cable of infinite length) that would behave like this, drawing 480 mA of current from a 24 volt source any time the switch is closed.  Hint: you don't have to think very hard!
