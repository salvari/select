Draw a schematic diagram showing how the windings (coils) of a {\it Wye} three-phase AC generator are connected together:

\vskip 100pt

Then, calculate the line voltage if the phase voltage in this generator is 7.1 kV.  Assume this generator operates in a balanced condition (all phase voltages and currents equal).

\vskip 10pt

$V_{line}$ =
