Suppose a student builds the following TRIAC circuit and finds that it does not work:

$$\epsfbox{01091x01.eps}$$

When the pushbutton switch is actuated, nothing happens.  What is wrong with this circuit?  Hint: the problem in this circuit is very subtle, and may be very difficult to discern.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Terminals MT1 and MT2 on the TRIAC need to be reversed, like this:

$$\epsfbox{01091x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This aspect of TRIACs is often omitted from texts on thyristor devices, but it is important for students to understand.  Even though TRIACs are bilateral devices, it still {\it does} matter where the triggering voltage is applied (between Gate and MT1, versus Gate and MT2).
