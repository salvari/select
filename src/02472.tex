What possible benefit is there to adding a voltage buffer to the front end of an inverting amplifier, as shown in the following schematic?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The voltage buffer raises the amplifier's input impedance without altering voltage gain.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students how this is very common: using a voltage buffer as an impedance transformation (or {\it isolation}) device so that a weak (high-impedance) source is able to drive an amplifier.
