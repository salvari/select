Calculate the approximate voltage gain ($A_V$) for the following common-collector amplifier circuit, expressing it as a ratio and as a decibel value.  Also calculate the quiescent DC voltage measured across the load resistor ($V_{load(DC)}$).  Assume a silicon transistor:

$$\epsfbox{02451x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (as a ratio) } \approx$ 
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (in decibels) } \approx$ 
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{load(DC)} \approx$ 
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (as a ratio) } \approx$ 1
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (in decibels) } \approx$ 0 dB
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{load(DC)} \approx$ 6.8 volts
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing much to comment on here -- just some practice on common-collector amplifier calculations.  Note that the approximations given here are based on the following assumptions:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} 0.7 volts drop (exactly) across base-emitter junction.
\item{$\bullet$} Infinite DC current gain ($\beta$) for transistor ($I_B = 0 \> \mu$A ; $I_C = I_E$).
\item{$\bullet$} Negligible loading of bias voltage divider by the emitter resistance.
\item{$\bullet$} Negligible dynamic emitter resistance ($r'_e = 0 \> \Omega$ )
\medskip

This question lends itself well to group discussions on component failure scenarios.  After discussing how to calculate the requested values, you might want to ask students to consider how these values would change given some specific component failures (open resistors, primarily, since this is perhaps the most common way that a resistor could fail).
