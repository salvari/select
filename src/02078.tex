Explain why the "impedance triangle" is {\it not} proper to use for relating total impedance, resistance, and reactance in parallel circuits as it is for series circuits:

$$\epsfbox{02078x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02078}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Impedances do not add in parallel.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what kind of a triangle {\it could} be properly applied to a parallel AC circuit, and why?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Trying to apply the $Z$-$R$-$X$ triangle directly to parallel AC circuits is a common mistake many new students make.  Key to knowing when and how to use triangles to graphically depict AC quantities is understanding {\it why} the triangle works as an analysis tool and {\it what} its sides represent.
