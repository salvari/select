A 4.7 $\mu$F capacitor ($C_i$) is charged to a voltage of 4 volts, then connected to the inverting input of an operational amplifier (with a 10 $\mu$F feedback capacitor, $C_f$).  What happens to the voltages across $C_i$ and $C_f$?  Explain your answer in detail.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{C_i}$ goes to zero, while $V_{C_{f}}$ increases by 1.88 volts.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The reason why $V_{C_i}$ goes to zero, of course, is a function of the opamp's negative feedback.  This aspect of the question provides an excellent opportunity for review of basic opamp principles.
