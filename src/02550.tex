Calculate the parallel impedance of the source resistor and source capacitor network in this JFET circuit, given an input frequency of 5 Hz:

$$\epsfbox{02550x01.eps}$$

$Z_{parallel}$ = 

\underbar{file 02550}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Z_{parallel}$ = 2.967 k$\Omega$ $\angle$ -25.98$^{o}$ 

\vskip 10pt

Note: the phase angle for this impedance is "extra".  What is most important is the magnitude of the parallel impedance.
