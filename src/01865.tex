Determine the total impedance of this series-parallel network by first converting it into an equivalent network that is either all-series or all-parallel:

$$\epsfbox{01865x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01865}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Equivalent parallel resistance and reactances:

$$\epsfbox{01865x02.eps}$$

$Z_{total} = 4.433 \hbox{ k}\Omega$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although there are other methods of solving for total impedance in a circuit such as this, I want students to become comfortable with series/parallel equivalents as an analysis tool.
