Draw a phasor diagram of the voltages in this Delta-connected polyphase system, and use trigonometry to calculate the voltage between points {\bf G} and {\bf B}.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01059x02.eps}$$

$V_{BG} =$ 415.7 V

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Of course, complex numbers may also be used to calculate $V_{AB}$, but the phasor approach has the benefit of graphical intuitiveness.
