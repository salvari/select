Suppose a magnet is moved toward a coil of wire, which is in turn connected to a variable resistance (potentiometer connected as a rheostat):

$$\epsfbox{03473x01.eps}$$

Determine the following:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} The polarity of the induced voltage (+ and -)
\item{$\bullet$} The direction of current through the resistance (conventional flow notation assumed)
\item{$\bullet$} The direction of physical force exerted on the {\it coil} as a result of Lenz's Law.
\item{$\bullet$} Whether the resistance needs to {\it increase} or {\it decrease} to maximize this force on the coil; or whether the amount of resistance is {\it irrelevant} to force.
