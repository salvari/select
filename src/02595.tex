Which of the following amplifier circuits will be most affected by the base-collector capacitance (shown here as an externally-connected 10 pF capacitor) as frequency increases?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The amplifier with the larger collector resistance will be affected more by the feedback capacitance, because its naturally greater voltage gain produces a larger voltage signal to be fed back to the base, for any given level of input signal.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to see, on a discrete component level, that for common-emitter amplifier there is a tradeoff between maximum gain and maximum operating frequency.  This question foreshadows the concept of Gain-Bandwidth Product (GBW) in operational amplifier circuits.

%INDEX% Voltage gain, reduction due to collector-base capacitance
