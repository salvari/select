Your project is to build a circuit that produces any arbitrary waveform desired, made of 16 discrete steps, all set by potentiometers.  The following schematic diagram is very general and does not contain enough specific information to guide you completely in the construction of this circuit.  In other words, you will have to figure out some of the details yourself!
