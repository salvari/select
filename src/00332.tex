{\it Magnetic} circuit breakers trip by the action of an electromagnet coil, through which all the load current passes.  When the attractive force of the magnetic field is strong enough, a mechanism triggers to snap the breaker contacts open, thus interrupting the circuit current.

What would the time-current curve for such a circuit breaker look like?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Magnetic-trip circuit breakers are very common in industry, but they are not appropriate for all applications.  Discuss this with your students, and try to think of applications where such an overcurrent protection device would {\it not} be appropriate.
