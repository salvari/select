Explain what a {\it TRIAC} is, and how it is at once similar and different from an SCR.  What applications might a TRIAC be used in that an SCR would be inappropriate for?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "TRIAC" functions as two reverse-parallel-connected SCR units, so as to be able to control AC and not just DC.

Follow-up question: draw the equivalent circuit for a TRIAC.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A popular application for TRIACs is lamp dimmer controls, for line-powered (50 or 60 Hz) incandescent lamps.  If time permits, discuss with your students how these lamp dimmer circuits control power to the lamp in a manner reminiscent of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation).
