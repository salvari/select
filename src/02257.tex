Ideally, an amplifier circuit increases the amplitude of a signal without altering the signal's wave-shape in the least.  Realistically, though, amplifiers always exhibit some degree of distortion.  

Describe how harmonic analysis -- either with a spectrum analyzer or some other piece of test equipment capable of measuring harmonics in a signal -- is used to quantify the distortion of an amplifier circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A pure sine wave is input to the amplifier under test, and a spectrum analyzer is connected to the amplifier's output.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer given is purposefully vague.  All I did is describe what gets connected to the amplifier, not how to interpret the measurements.  Ask your students to explain {\it why} a pure sine wave is chosen as the test signal, and what sort of response would be considered ideal to see on the spectrum analyzer.
