This circuit has an unusual problem.  When the switch is open, the LED turns on.  When the switch is closed, the LED turns off.  However, when the switch is opened again, the LED often does not turn back on until some time has passed.  Others notice that sometimes the LED will turn on and off just by waving their hand next to it, with the switch in the open position.

Explain what is happening here, and also propose a solution to eliminate the unpredictability when the switch is open.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The LED status is unpredictable when the switch is open, because the transistor's gate is free to "pick up" static electric voltages induced by nearby objects.  The solution is to provide a resistive path for any static voltage to discharge when the switch is open.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students to place a resistor in this circuit in such a way as to meet the requirements of the given solution.

Incidentally, this circuit makes an excellent classroom demonstration for students to experiment with.
