Something is wrong with this operational amplifier circuit.  The load voltage is supposed to be 8.0 volts, but instead it measures about 10.8 volts:

$$\epsfbox{02744x01.eps}$$

Using your digital multimeter, you measure 11.5 volts between test point TP3 and ground.  Note that $V_Z$ shown in the schematic is a {\it specification} for the zener diode, and not an actual voltmeter measurement.  From this information, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit, and also identify two circuit elements that could not possibly be to blame (i.e. two things that you know {\it must} be functioning properly, no matter what else may be faulted).  The circuit elements you identify as either possibly faulted or properly functioning can be wires, traces, and connections as well as components.  Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note: the following answers are not exhaustive.  There may be more circuit elements possibly at fault and more circuit elements known to be functioning properly!

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Circuit elements that are possibly faulted
\item{1.} Zener diode failed open
\item{2.} Resistor $R_1$ failed shorted
\item{3.} Resistor $R_2$ failed open
\item{4.} Resistor $R_3$ failed shorted
\medskip

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Circuit elements that must be functioning properly, no matter what else may be faulted
\item{1.} +12 volt power supply rail
\item{2.} Wire from TP4 to TP5
\item{3.} Transistor $Q_1$ base-emitter junction (dropping 0.7 volts)
