An Exclusive-OR gate has the following Boolean expression:

$$A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B$$

Draw the schematic diagram for a gate circuit exhibiting this Boolean function, constructed entirely from NAND gates.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

An interesting feature of this circuit is the final three NAND gates: two NAND gates feeding into a third NAND gate is equivalent to two AND gates feeding into an OR gate, thanks to DeMorgan's Theorem!
