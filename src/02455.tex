Approximate the following values for this common-emitter amplifier circuit, assuming the use of a silicon transistor:

$$\epsfbox{02455x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (as a ratio) } \approx$ 
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (in decibels) } \approx$ 
\item{$\bullet$} $Z_{in} \approx$ 
\item{$\bullet$} $Z_{out} \approx$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (as a ratio) } \approx$ 112.5
\item{$\bullet$} $A_V \hbox{ (in decibels) } \approx$ 41.02 dB
\item{$\bullet$} $Z_{in} \approx$ 2.175 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} $Z_{out} \approx$ 9.1 k$\Omega$
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: how would these figures change, if at all, supposing the transistor had an infinite current gain ($\beta = \infty$)?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing much to comment on here -- just some practice on common-emitter amplifier calculations.  In calculating the dynamic emitter resistance, the following assumptions were taken:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $r'_e = 25 \hbox{ mV} / I_E$
\item{$\bullet$} 0.7 volts drop (exactly) across base-emitter junction.
\item{$\bullet$} Negligible loading of bias voltage divider by the emitter resistance.
\medskip

\goodbreak

After calculating $r'_e$, the following equations were used to approximate the impedances:

$$Z_{in} \approx R_1 \> || \> R_2 \> || \> (\beta + 1)r'_e$$

$$Z_{out} \approx R_C$$

Voltage gain was approximated through the use of this equation:

$$A_V \approx {R_C \> || \> R_{load} \over r'_e}$$

This question lends itself well to group discussions on component failure scenarios.  After discussing how to calculate the requested values, you might want to ask students to consider how these values would change given some specific component failures (open resistors, primarily, since this is perhaps the most common way that a resistor could fail).
