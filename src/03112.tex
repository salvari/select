%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this report form is to familiarize students with the concept of time management as it relates to project completion.  Too many students have a tendency to do little or nothing until just before their project is due.  By assigning a grade value for progress made each day, you help them learn time management skills and also help them complete their projects sooner (and better!).
