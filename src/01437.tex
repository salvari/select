The 74HC154 is a high-speed CMOS (TTL-compatible) integrated circuit decoder, which may also be used as a demultiplexer:

$$\epsfbox{01437x01.eps}$$

What terminal(s) do we use for the signal input, if using this chip as a {\it demultiplexer} and not just a decoder?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use the enable terminals (together) as one "input" terminal.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Explain to your students that "decoder" and "demultiplexer" are really just two different words for the same device, seeing as how all real decoders come equipped with enable inputs.
