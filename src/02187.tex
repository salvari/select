A large electrical load is outfitted with a wattmeter to measure its true power.  If the load voltage is 7.2 kV and the load current is 24 amps, calculate the load's apparent power ($S$).  Calculate the power factor and also the phase angle between voltage and current in the circuit if the wattmeter registers 155 kW at those same voltage and current values.

Draw a "power triangle" for this circuit, graphically showing the relationships between apparent power, true power, and phase angle.

This question provides more practice for students with trigonometry, as well as reinforcing the relationships between $S$, $P$, $\Theta$, and power factor.
