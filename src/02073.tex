Metal Oxide Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) differ in behavior from Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) in several ways.  Address each one of these behavioral aspects in your answer:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Current gain
\item{$\bullet$} Conduction with no input (gate/base) signal
\item{$\bullet$} Polarization
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

MOSFETs have {\it much} greater current gains than BJTs.

\vskip 10pt

BJTs are normally-off devices, whereas a MOSFET may either be normally-on or normally-off depending on its manufacture.

\vskip 10pt

MOSFETs can pass current from source to drain, or from drain to source with equal ease.  BJTs can only pass current from emitter to collector in one direction.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

For each one of these behavioral aspects, discuss with your students exactly {\it why} the two transistors types differ.
