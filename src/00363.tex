Size the resistor in this voltage divider circuit to provide 5 volts to the load, assuming that the load will draw 75 mA of current at this voltage:

$$\epsfbox{00363x01.eps}$$

As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of both resistors.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

R = 264 $\Omega$.  The 330 $\Omega$ resistor must have a power dissipation rating of at least 3 watts, while the 264 $\Omega$ resistor will fare well even with a (low) power dissipation rating of ${1 \over 8}$ watt.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what would change in this divider circuit if the load were to suddenly draw more, or less, current.
