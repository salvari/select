Write the Boolean expression for this logic gate circuit, then reduce that expression to its simplest form using any applicable Boolean laws and theorems.  Finally, draw a new gate circuit diagram based on the simplified Boolean expression that performs the exact same logic function.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This particular circuit is an example of how a combinational logic function may be implemented using nothing but NAND gates.
