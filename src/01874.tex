The coefficient of magnetic coupling between two coils affects the amount of mutual inductance between those two coils.  This fact should be obvious, as coils not sharing any magnetic flux ($k = 0$) cannot have any mutual inductance between them.

Write an equation defining $M$ in terms of $L_1$ and $L_2$, when $k$ is something less than 1.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$M = k \sqrt{L_1 L_2}$

Ask your students {\it how} they obtained their answer.  Of course this equation may be found in many basic electronics textbooks, but the point of this question is for students to see how it may be {\it derived} from the equations they already know.
