%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here's a hint: where does the opamp get its power from?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Believe it or not, I actually sat in an electronics class one time and listened to an instructor present the precision rectifier opamp circuit as a "precision rectifier for a power supply".  He was serious, too, claiming that this type of circuitry was used to provide split (+V/-V) voltage outputs for benchtop power supplies.  The saddest part of this ordeal is that none of his students recognized anything wrong with his statement (or at least did not feel comfortable in raising a question about it).
