Complete the circuit, showing how the pushbutton switch could be connected to the gate of the MOSFET in order to exert control over the load:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This solution, while workable, is not the most practical.  Improve on this design!

$$\epsfbox{02124x02.eps}$$

Follow-up question: would you say this transistor {\it sources} current to the load, or {\it sinks} current from the load?  Explain your answer.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why the circuit shown in the answer would not necessarily be practical, and work together to develop a better design.
