Calculate the charging current through each battery, using the Superposition Theorem (ignore all wire and connection resistances -- only consider the resistance of each fuse):

$$\epsfbox{00695x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00695}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{generator} =$ 16.82 A

\vskip 10pt

$I_{battery1} =$ 13.91 A

\vskip 10pt

$I_{battery2} =$ 2.91 A

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: identify any safety hazards that could arise as a result of excessive resistance in the fuse holders (e.g., corrosion build-up on the metal tabs where the fuse clips in to the fuse-holder).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Though there are other methods of analysis for this circuit, it is still a good application of Superposition Theorem.
