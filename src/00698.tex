$$\epsfbox{00698x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00698}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This circuit provides {\it dynamic} braking.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is apparent from the schematic diagram that the motor's field winding continues to receive power when the switch is in the "brake" position.  Ask the students why this is necessary for dynamic braking to work.  Ask them what would happen if the field winding were de-energized as well as the armature, as the switch moved to the "brake" position.
