What would happen to the impedance transformation ratio if a short-circuit developed between some of the turns in the 300-turn winding of this transformer?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The impedance ratio would increase.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is somewhat of a "trick" question, because students are accustomed to equating a "short" with a decrease in impedance.  While this is generally true, what we're talking about here is an impedance {\it ratio}, rather than any one impedance in particular.
