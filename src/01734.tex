A quantity often useful in electric circuit analysis is {\it conductance}, defined as the reciprocal of resistance:

$$G = {1 \over R}$$

In a series circuit, resistance increases and conductance decreases with the addition of more resistors:

$$\epsfbox{01734x01.eps}$$

Describe what happens to total resistance and total conductance with the addition of {\it parallel} resistors:

$$\epsfbox{01734x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01734}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

When successive resistors are connected in parallel, total resistance {\it decreases} while total conductance {\it increases}.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what is the exact formula that describes total conductance in a network of parallel conductances?

$$G_{total} = \hbox{ ???}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Once students recognize the mathematical relationship between resistance and conductance ($G = {1 \over R}$), and they realize that parallel conductances add just like series resistances add, it is but a short exercise in algebra to develop the parallel resistance formula ($R_{parallel} = {1 \over { {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + \cdots {1 \over R_n} } }$).
