%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"ESR" stands for {\it Equivalent Series Resistance}, usually being a consequence of the capacitor's dielectric substance.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why ESR matters, especially in decoupling applications where capacitors are expected to handle large ${dv \over dt}$ transients.
