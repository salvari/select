One day you decide to water your garden, using a garden hose that is already connected to a spigot on the side of your house:

$$\epsfbox{01568x01.eps}$$

When you turn on the valve at the spigot, though, no water comes out the nozzle at the other end of the hose.  Explain the steps you would take to troubleshoot this problem.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an excellent question for discussion amongst your classmates!  Two things I recommend, though:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Identify some probable sources of trouble in this garden hose "system."
\item{$\bullet$} Proceed in a logical manner to find the trouble as efficiently as possible.
\medskip

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students both probable causes of this problem as well as strategies for locating the problem.  Encourage students to analyze the system by dividing it into sections.  Since garden hoses easily detach from spigots and nozzles alike, they lend themselves well to the so-called "divide-and-conquer" method of troubleshooting.
