Predict how the operation of this sensitive audio detector circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03726x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_1$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Wiper fails to contact slide in potentiometer:

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open: {\it No effect on small signals, clipping of large signals will be incomplete (only one-half of the waveform will be clipped in amplitude).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails shorted: {\it No sound heard at headphones at all.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transformer $T_1$ primary winding fails open: {\it No sound heard at headphones at all.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it No sound heard at headphones at all.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_1$: {\it Volume (slightly) louder than usual.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Wiper fails to contact slide in potentiometer: {\it No sound heard at headphones at all.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
