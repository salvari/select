What would be wrong about measuring the resistance of a light bulb while it is being powered by a battery?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The voltage impressed across the light bulb by the battery will interfere with the ohmmeter's measurement.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This principle is very easy to illustrate, simply by building a "live" circuit and trying to measure the resistance of a known component in that circuit, while energized.  Different ohmmeters will, of course, respond differently to this abuse, but none will yield the proper value for that component's resistance.
