Predict how the operation of this sound-activated lamp circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03894x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_2$ fails shorted between collector and emitter:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge past resistor $R_5$:
\vskip 5pt
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it Lamp status does not change.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open: {\it Lamp status does not change.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_1$ fails open: {\it Circuit works fine for a few cycles, then fails with the lamp either remaining on or remaining off (due to failed transistor $Q_2$).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_2$ fails shorted between collector and emitter: {\it Lamp remains on.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge past resistor $R_5$: {\it Possible failure of flip-flop $U_2$ or transistor $Q_2$ after extended periods of time with the lamp on.}
\vskip 5pt

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
