The simplest and least expensive style of electric motor control is the so-called {\it across-the-line} starter.  Describe how this motor control circuit functions, and also define the word "starter" in this context.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "starter" is another name for the large power relay used to conduct current to the motor lines.  Starters are also known as {\it contactors}, and are usually labeled with the letter "M" in ladder diagrams.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to identify any motor control circuit diagrams they've already seen as being "across-the-line."  If there are no convenient motor control circuit diagrams available for illustration, you may want to ask a student to draw an "across-the-line" starter circuit on the whiteboard for everyone to see.
