Determine the type (LP, HP, BP, BS) and cutoff frequency of this active filter circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02475x01.eps}$$

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a high-pass filter circuit.

$f_{-3dB}$ = 482.3 Hz

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: the feedback resistor network comprised of the 52 k$\Omega$ and 91 k$\Omega$ resistors not only provides a gain of 1.75 (4.86 dB), but these values were also intentionally chosen to compensate for the effects of DC bias current through the opamp input terminals.  You will notice that the {\it parallel} combination of 52 k$\Omega$ and 91 k$\Omega$ is approximately equal to 33 k$\Omega$.  Explain why this is significant with reference to the Superposition theorem.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain how they arrived at their answers: what formulae did they use, and how did they determine the type of the filter circuit that this is?  Ask them if there was any information given in the diagram irrelevant to either determination.
