Suppose an AC signal amplifier circuit has a voltage gain (ratio) of 2.  That is, $V_{out}$ is twice as large as $V_{in}$:

$$\epsfbox{00827x01.eps}$$

If we were to try to rate this amplifier's gain in terms of the relative power dissipated by a given load resistance ($P_{load}$ when powered by $V_{out}$, versus $P_{load}$ when powered by $V_{in}$), what {\it decibel} figure would we calculate?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$A_P =$ 6.02 dB

An easy way to illustrate this principle is to ask your students to calculate the power dissipation of a 1200 watt heating element rated for 120 volts, if connected to a 240 volt source.  The answer is {\it not} 2400 watts!

%INDEX% Gain, relationship of voltage gain to power gain (in units of decibels)
