Predict how the operation of this sound-activated relay circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03767x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Zener diode $D_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Microphone voice coil fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Comparator $U_1$ fails with output saturated positive:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_3$ fails shorted:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Zener diode $D_1$ fails open: {\it Volume threshold increases (relay may not energize at all).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it Any sound at all will energize the relay.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it Relay refuses to energize.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Microphone voice coil fails open: {\it Relay energizes randomly, as comparator input is now sensitive to static electricity.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Comparator $U_1$ fails with output saturated positive: {\it Relay immediately energizes, whether or not there is sound.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Diode $D_3$ fails shorted: {\it Relay refuses to energize, SCR will likely be damaged due to overheating after a sound event.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
