Suppose you were using a 600 watt, 120 volt electric heater to pre-heat the oil in a hydraulic system, but determined later that this heater delivered too much heat to the oil.  A 400 watt heater would be more appropriate for the task, but unfortunately another heater is not available in that power rating.

You realize that the power output of this 600 watt heater could be reduced by supplying it with less voltage.  You also realize that a transformer could be used to reduce the AC voltage delivered to the heater without incurring the large power losses of a voltage-dropping resistor.

The following transformer types are available to use for the task:

$$\epsfbox{00094x01.eps}$$

Design a circuit that uses one or more of these transformers to reduce the line voltage (120 VAC) down to an appropriate level so that the 600 watt heater will only output (approximately) 400 watts.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

You should have calculated a heater voltage of 98 volts necessary to produce 400 watts from the same heater that outputs 600 watts at 120 volts.  It is possible to reduce 120 volts down to approximately 98 volts using the transformers shown here.  Perhaps the most direct solution is to connect one of these units in a "bucking" configuration.

There is more than one possible solution to this problem using the transformer types available.  You should realize, though, that there is more to consider than just getting the right voltage.  Equally important to the solution is the transformers' ability to handle the current demanded by the heater.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A problem such as this is very realistic: having to engineer a solution to a practical dilemma with a limited choice of components.  Let your students know that solving problems in real life involves {\it creativity} just as much as it involves mathematical calculations and other "closed form" (single right answer) methods.
