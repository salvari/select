When using a padlock to secure a disconnect device in the "open" (off) state, who should be able to open that lock?  In other words, how many other people should share a key to the lock you use to secure a breaker or switch in the safe position, if you are the one working on the system?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

You and you alone should be able to open that lock.  It needs to be a {\it personal} lock, not a lock whose key is shared by other people.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why a personal lock is preferred over a "group" lock for locking out circuit disconnect devices.
