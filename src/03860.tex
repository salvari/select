A "buck" switching converter delivers 5.2 volts at 23 amps to a DC load, while receiving an input of 27.5 volts at 4.8 amps.  Calculate the efficiency of this converter circuit under the stated conditions, as well as the theoretical input current if the circuit were 100\% efficient (assuming load voltage and current remain the same, as well as input voltage).
