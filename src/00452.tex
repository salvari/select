Calculate the voltage across a 470 $\mu$F capacitor after discharging through a 10 k$\Omega$ resistor for 9 seconds, if the capacitor's original voltage (at $t = 0$) was 24 volts.

Also, express this amount of time (9 seconds) in terms of how many {\it time constants} have elapsed.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$E_C = 3.537$ volts @ $t = 9$ seconds.

\vskip 10pt

9 s = 1.915 time constants ($1.915\tau$)

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, students must choose which equation to use for the calculation, calculate the time constant for the circuit, and put all the variables in the right place to obtain the correct answer.  Discuss all these steps with your students, allowing them to explain how they approached the question.
