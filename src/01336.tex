Product-of-Sum Boolean expressions all follow the same general form.  As such, their equivalent logic gate circuits likewise follow a common form.  Translate each of these POS expressions into its equivalent logic gate circuit:

\vskip 10pt

$$(A + B)(A + \overline{B})$$

\vskip 10pt

$$(A + \overline{B})(\overline{A} + B)$$

\vskip 10pt

$$(A + B + C)(\overline{A} + B + \overline{C})(A + B + \overline{C})$$

\vskip 10pt

\vskip 30pt

$$\epsfbox{01336x02.eps}$$

\vskip 30pt

$$\epsfbox{01336x03.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The translation from Boolean POS to gate circuit should not be difficult.  The point of this question is to get students thinking in terms of sum-of-products form, so they will be ready for the next step: linking this concept with truth tables.
