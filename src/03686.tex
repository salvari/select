In this 480 volt AC induction motor control circuit, a three-pole relay (typically called a {\it contactor}) is used to switch power on and off to the motor.  The contactor itself is controlled by a smaller switch, which gets 120 volts AC from a step-down transformer to energize the contactor's magnetic coil.  Although this motor control circuit used to work just fine, today the motor refuses to start.

Using your AC voltmeter, you measure 478 volts AC between L1 and L2, 479 volts AC between L2 and L3, and 478 volts AC between L1 and L3.  With the switch in the "on" position, you measure 117 volts AC between terminals X1 and X2 on the transformer.  From this information, identify the following:

\item{$\bullet$} \underbar{Two} components or wires in the circuit that you know cannot be failed either open or shorted, besides the 480 volt AC source which is obviously operational.
\vskip 40pt
\item{$\bullet$} \underbar{Two} different component or wire failures in the circuit, either one of which could account for the problem and the measurement values, and the types of failures they would be (either open or shorted).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Components known to be in good working condition:}

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf Components which could possibly be faulted:}

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Contactor coil failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Switch failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Wiring between X1 and A1 failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Wiring between X2 and switch failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Wiring between switch and A2 failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Motor winding(s) failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Wire(s) from fuses to contactor failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Contactor switch contact(s) failed open
