Something is wrong with this operational amplifier circuit.  The load voltage is supposed to be 8.0 volts, but instead it measures 0 volts:

$$\epsfbox{02745x01.eps}$$

Using your digital multimeter, you also measure 0 volts between test point TP1 and ground.  Note that $V_Z$ shown in the schematic is a {\it specification} for the zener diode, and not an actual voltmeter measurement.  From this information, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit.  The circuit elements you identify as possibly faulted can be wires, traces, and connections as well as components.  Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note: the following answers are not exhaustive.  There may be more circuit elements possibly at fault and more circuit elements known to be functioning properly!

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Circuit elements that are possibly faulted
\item{1.} Zener diode failed shorted
\item{2.} Resistor $R_3$ failed open
\item{3.} Power supply (+12/-12 volts) completely failed
