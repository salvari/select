Explain how frequency is adjusted in your signal generator circuit.  Your circuit should contain both a "coarse" and a "fine" adjustment (the coarse adjustment could be a multi-position switch, to select different frequency ranges).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Frequency adjustment is usually accomplished by means of a resistor/capacitor network.  What I'm looking for here is a detailed explanation of how this network functions to control the frequency of oscillation.  To answer this, of course, you must have a firm understanding of how the signal generator IC works internally.

Students should be able to find this information in their chips' datasheet(s).
