Rectifying diodes, like many other types of semiconductor components, should be {\it derated} at elevated ambient temperatures.  Datasheets often provide "derating curves" that prescribe the maximum current for a range of ambient temperatures.

Explain just what "derating" is, and why it is so important for semiconductor devices.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Derating" means to downgrade the maximum power rating of a component, in a response to changes in other factors affecting the component's operation.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why temperature is such a critical factor in semiconductor component operation.  What happens to a semiconductor junction when it is heated?  What may happen if it is heated too much?
