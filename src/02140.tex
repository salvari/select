A unijunction transistor with an intrinsic standoff ratio ($\eta$) of 0.8 is powered by a 15 volt DC source.  Calculate the emitter voltage needed to "trigger" this UJT into its conductive state.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_P \approx$ 12.7 volts

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing special here, just practice calculating the trigger voltage.  Note to your students that the symbol for the intrinsic standoff ratio ($\eta$) is the Greek letter "eta," which also happens to be used to symbolize efficiency.
