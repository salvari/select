The following circuit has a problem: the electric motor refuses to turn on.

$$\epsfbox{03381x01.eps}$$

With the switch in the "on" position, you check the power source with your voltmeter, measuring 115 volts between terminals 1 and 3.  Next, you check for voltage between terminals 5 and 8, and you measure 115 volts there as well.  Based on this information, classify the status of each component/connection listed using one of these four ranks:

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

$$\vbox{\offinterlineskip
\halign{\strut
\vrule \quad\hfil # \ \hfil & 
\vrule \quad\hfil # \ \hfil \vrule \cr
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% First row
{\bf Rank} & {\bf Meaning} \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Second row
{\it Definitely good} & The measurements prove it is in good working order \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Third row
{\it Definitely bad} & The measurements prove it must be the only problem in the circuit \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Fourth row
{\it Possibly bad} & Could be the only problem, but something else might be bad instead \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
%
% Fifth row
{\it Uncertain} & Could be good or bad -- if bad, it would not be the only problem \cr
%
\noalign{\hrule}
} % End of \halign 
}$$ % End of \vbox

Rank the following circuit components.  Assume that there may be more than one thing wrong with this circuit!

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Power plug -- {\it definitely good}, {\it definitely bad}, {\it possibly bad}, or {\it uncertain}?
\item{$\bullet$} Switch -- {\it definitely good}, {\it definitely bad}, {\it possibly bad}, or {\it uncertain}?
\item{$\bullet$} Fuse -- {\it definitely good}, {\it definitely bad}, {\it possibly bad}, or {\it uncertain}?
\item{$\bullet$} Motor -- {\it definitely good}, {\it definitely bad}, {\it possibly bad}, or {\it uncertain}?
