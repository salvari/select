Something is wrong with this circuit.  Based on the oscilloscope's display, determine whether the battery or the function generator is faulty:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The battery is faulty.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: discuss how accidently setting the coupling control on the oscilloscope to "AC" instead of "DC" would also cause this waveform to show on the screen (even with a good battery).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question challenges students to apply their knowledge of AC+DC mixed signals to oscilloscope display patterns, in order to determine whether it is the battery or the function generator which has failed.
