Determine the amount of voltage measured at points {\bf A} and {\bf B} with reference to ground, and also determine voltage $V_{AB}$ (defined here as the voltage indicated by a voltmeter with the red test lead touching point {\bf A} and the black test lead touching point {\bf B}):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_A = +9 \hbox{ volts}$

$V_B = +6 \hbox{ volts}$

$V_{AB} = +3 \hbox{ volts}$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain why the mathematical signs ("+") are important in these answers.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Determining differential voltages is a skill that many students find frustrating to attain.  There is more than one way to explain how to arrive at +3 volts as the answer for $V_{AB}$, and it is good for students to see more than one way presented.
