Can this detector be used to indicate the presence of direct current (DC), or only AC within the audio frequency range?  How about AC signals beyond the audio frequency range?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This detector is useful for detecting the presence of signals over an extremely wide frequency range (and down to zero -- DC), although the detector admittedly provides much more information about the nature of the signal if its frequency lies within the audio range.  To use this detector for DC signals and for signals above the audio range may require some creativity, but it most certainly can be done!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students share their successes with signal detection above and below the audio frequency range.  What technique(s) yielded the best (most sensitive) results?
