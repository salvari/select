%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Battery electrochemistry is quite complex, and not easily addressed in a class environment unless all students have a good background knowledge of chemistry.  It is not the point of this question to address issues of electrochemistry, but merely to point out the nature of a battery's energy source.
