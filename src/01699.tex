Show how this ammeter would be connected to the light bulb circuit to measure the circuit's electric current:

$$\epsfbox{01699x01.eps}$$

Also, draw a schematic diagram of this same circuit (with the ammeter connected).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01699x02.eps}$$

(Note: the meter's indication of 3.09 amps is arbitrary, and not important to the question).

$$\epsfbox{01699x03.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The important thing for students to understand in this question is that the ammeter must become part of the path that the electric current flows through.  Explain how this fact contains an element of danger, as contrasted against the relatively "non-invasive" connection of a voltmeter to a circuit.
