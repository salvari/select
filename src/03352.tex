Resistors are often used to drop excessive voltage so that low-voltage devices may successfully operate from the power provided by high(er)-voltage sources.  For example, this 15 volt electric motor uses a resistor connected in series to be able to operate from the output of the 36 volt battery:

$$\epsfbox{03352x01.eps}$$

Calculate the necessary resistance of this resistor, as well as its minimum power rating (choose from 10 watt, 15 watt, 25 watt, 35 watt, or 50 watt).

\vskip 10pt

$R$ = \hskip 140pt $P$ (rating) =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R$ = 16.15 $\Omega$ \hskip 100pt $P$ (rating) = 35 watt minimum
