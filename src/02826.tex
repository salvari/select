Write a Boolean expression for this truth table, then simplify that expression as much as possible, and draw a logic gate circuit equivalent to that simplified expression:

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Original POS expression:

$$(\overline{A} + \overline{B} + C)(\overline{A} + \overline{B} + \overline{C})$$

Simplified gate circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02826x01.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what other single gate type will satisfy the truth table (besides a Negative-OR gate)?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students to implement the original POS expression directly with logic gates (three-input gates are acceptable to use).  Is the "simplified" POS expression shown in the answer simpler in the context of real gate circuits?  Ask your students what lesson this comparison holds for Boolean simplification techniques and their application to real-world circuits.
