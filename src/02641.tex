Determine what will happen to the following voltages when the {\it noninverting} input voltage increases.  Consider an "increasing" voltage to be one that becomes more positive with respect to ground, and a "decreasing" voltage to be one that becomes more negative with respect to ground:

\item{$\bullet$} Voltage at collector of $Q_6$ ({\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it no change})
\item{$\bullet$} Voltage at collector of $Q_{17}$ ({\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it no change})
\item{$\bullet$} Voltage at collector of $Q_{15}$ ({\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it no change})
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{output}$ ({\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it no change})
