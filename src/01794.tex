Shown here is an ammeter circuit with a special type of selector switch, called a {\it make-before-break} selector:

$$\epsfbox{01794x02.eps}$$

This special kind of selector switch is important to have in an ammeter circuit such as the one shown above.  If we were to build such a similar ammeter using a normal ({\it break-before-make}) selector switch, the meter would be susceptible to damage during normal use:

$$\epsfbox{01794x01.eps}$$

Explain why the first circuit design is superior to the second, and what form of use would prove damaging to the second design (but not to the first).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The type of use that would damage the second meter but not the first is changing ranges while measuring current.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Another solution to the break-before-make problem is to use a {\it ring shunt} circuit rather than have an independent range resistor for each current measurement range.
