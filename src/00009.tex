The Greek word for {\it amber} (fossilized resin) is {\it elektron}.  Explain how this came to be the word describing a certain type of subatomic particle (electron).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

When a piece of amber is rubbed with a cloth, a static electric charge develops on both objects.  Early experimenters postulated the existence of an invisible fluid that was transferred between the amber and the cloth.  Later, it was discovered that tiny sub-atomic particles constituted this "fluid," and the name {\it electron} was given to them.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question provides a good opportunity to discuss the history of electricity, and how its understanding and mastery has dramatically changed peoples' lives.  Be sure to ask questions about Benjamin Franklin and the modeling of electricity as a {\it fluid}.  Scientific discovery is often assisted by models, but may also be hindered by them as well.  Franklin's model of electricity as a fluid has done both (conventional versus electron flow notation)!
