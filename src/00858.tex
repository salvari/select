Determine the equivalent series-connected resistor and capacitor values for this parallel circuit:

$$\epsfbox{00858x01.eps}$$

Also, express the total impedance of either circuit (since they are electrically equivalent to one another, they should have the same total impedance) in {\it complex form}.  That is, express ${\bf Z}$ as a quantity with both a magnitude and an angle.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_{series} =$ 454.8 $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$C_{series} =$ 3.3 $\mu$F

\vskip 10pt

${\bf Z_{total}} =$ 1066 $\Omega$ $\angle$ -64.75$^{o}$
