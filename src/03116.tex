Calculate all currents in this DC circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03116x01.eps}$$

Hint: it may help you to set up the necessary equation by labeling the current through the lower resistor as $I$ and the current through the upper resistor as $I$ + 0.005.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Upper resistor current = 8.5 mA; lower resistor current = 3.5 mA

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is an interesting circuit to mathematically analyze.  While not requiring simultaneous equations, or even a network theorem such as Superposition or Th\'evenin's, it is nevertheless a good exercise in applying the basic laws of circuit analysis (Ohm's, Kirchhoff's) and algebra.
