%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf For upper voltmeter:}

$V_{max}$ = 10.24 volts  \hskip 15pt $V_{min}$ = 1.71 volts

\vskip 10pt

\noindent
{\bf For lower voltmeter:}

$V_{max}$ = 12.29 volts  \hskip 15pt $V_{min}$ = 3.76 volts

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: identify the positions in which the potentiometer wiper must be set in order to obtain all four of the voltage readings shown above.
