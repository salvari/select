Draw the pattern of the magnetic field produced by electric current through a straight wire and through a wire coil:

Explain your answer using either the {\it right-hand rule} (conventional flow) or the {\it left-hand rule} (electron flow).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In your students' research, they will encounter a "right-hand rule" as well as a "left-hand rule" for relating electric current with magnetic field directions.  The distinction between the two rules depends on whether the text uses "conventional flow" notation or "electron flow" notation to denote the movement of electrical charge through the conductors.  Sadly, this is another one of those concepts in electricity that has been made unnecessarily confusing by the prevalence of two "standard" notions for electric current.
