Suppose we have an alternator with three sets of windings, {\bf A}, {\bf B}, and {\bf C}:

$$\epsfbox{01887x01.eps}$$

Each pair of windings in each set is series-connected, so they act as just three separate windings (pay close attention to the phase-marking dots!):

$$\epsfbox{01887x02.eps}$$

If one end of each winding pair were connected together at a common ground point, and each winding pair output 70 volts RMS, how much voltage would be measured between any two open wires?

$$\epsfbox{01887x03.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

121.2 volts

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: draw a phasor diagram showing how the difference in potential (voltage) between the wire ends is equal to 121.2 volts, when each winding coil's voltage is 70 volts.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is a good exercise of students' knowledge of phase shift, in a very practical context.
