Explain the difference between relative permeability ($\mu_r$) and absolute permeability ($\mu$).  How do the units of measurement differ between these two quantities?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$\mu_r = {\mu \over \mu_0}$

\vskip 10pt

Absolute permeability is measured in units of Webers per Amp-meter (Wb/Am), while relative permeability has no unit at all.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain {\it why} relative permeability ($\mu_r$) is unitless.  Are there any other variables they've encountered in their science studies that are similarly unitless?

Did any of your students research the value of absolute permeability of free space ($\mu_0$)?  If so, what figure did they obtain?
