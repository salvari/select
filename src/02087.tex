A series AC circuit exhibits a total impedance of 2.5 k$\Omega$, with a phase shift of 30 degrees between voltage and current.  Drawn in an impedance triangle, it looks like this:

$$\epsfbox{02087x01.eps}$$

Use the appropriate trigonometric functions to calculate the equivalent values of $R$ and $X$ in this series circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R$ = 2.165 k$\Omega$

$X$ = 1.25 k$\Omega$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are a few different ways one could solve for $R$ and $X$ in this trigonometry problem.  This would be a good opportunity to have your students present problem-solving strategies on the board in front of class so everyone gets an opportunity to see multiple techniques.
