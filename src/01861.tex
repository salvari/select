Mathematical analysis of the Maxwell-Wien bridge is as follows:

$$\epsfbox{01861x01.eps}$$

$${\bf Z}_x = R_x + j\omega L_x \hskip 10pt \hbox{Impedance of unknown inductance/resistance arm}$$

$${\bf Z}_s = {1 \over {{1 \over R_s} + {1 \over -j{1 \over \omega C_s}}}} \hskip 10pt \hbox{Impedance of standard capacitance/resistance arm}$$

$${\bf Y}_s = {1 \over R_s} + j\omega C_s \hskip 10pt \hbox{Admittance of standard capacitance/resistance arm}$$

$${{\bf Z_x} \over {\bf Z_R}} = {{\bf Z_R} \over {\bf Z_s}} \hskip 10pt \hbox{ or } \hskip 10pt {{\bf Z_x} \over {\bf Z_R}} = {{\bf Z_R}{\bf Y_s}} \hskip 10pt \hbox{Bridge balance equation}$$

$${\bf Z_x} = R^2 {\bf Y}_s$$

$$R_x + j\omega L_x = R^2 \left( {1 \over R_s} + j\omega C_s \right)$$

$$R_x + j\omega L_x = {R^2 \over R_s} + j\omega R^2 C_s$$

$$\hbox{Separating real and imaginary terms . . .}$$

$$R_x = {R^2 \over R_s} \hskip 10pt \hbox{(Real)}$$

$$j\omega L_x = j\omega R^2 C_s  \hskip 10pt \hbox{(Imaginary)}$$

$$L_x = R^2 C_s$$

Note that neither of the two equations solving for unknown quantities ($R_x = {R^2 \over R_s}$ and $L_x = R^2 C_s$) contain the variable $\omega$.  What does this indicate about the Maxwell-Wien bridge?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This means the source frequency is irrelevant to bridge balance.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A rule that students will need to be aware of in order to follow all the algebra shown here is ${1 \over j} = -j$.  A brief proof is given here:

$$j^2 = -1$$

$${1 \over j^2} = {1 \over -1}$$

$${j \over j^2} = {j \over -1}$$

$${j \over j^2} = -j$$

$${1 \over j} = -j$$

Otherwise, the admittance equation (${\bf Y}_s = {1 \over R_s} + j\omega C_s$) will not make sense.

One type of AC bridge is called a {\it noise bridge}, using a "noise" (broadly mixed frequencies) source as the excitation voltage.  Discuss with your students how the Maxwell-Wien bridge would be a suitable topology for use with a noise source, whereas other bridge topologies might not.
