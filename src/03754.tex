A clever way to produce sine waves is to pass the output of a square-wave oscillator through a low-pass filter circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03754x01.eps}$$

Explain how this principle works, based on your knowledge of Fourier's theorem.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The LP filter blocks all harmonics of the square wave except the fundamental (1st harmonic), resulting in a sinusoidal output.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what they think about the {\it rolloff} requirement for this LP filter.  Will any LP filter work, or do we need something special?
