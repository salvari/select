Explain all the steps necessary to calculate the amount of current in this capacitive AC circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01551x01.eps}$$

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I = 22.6$ mA

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The current is not difficult to calculate, so obviously the most important aspect of this question is not the math.  Rather, it is the {\it procedure} of calculation: what to do first, second, third, etc., in obtaining the final answer.
