Calculate the line current and power factor in this AC power system:

$$\epsfbox{00643x01.eps}$$

Now, calculate the line current and power factor for the same circuit after the addition of a capacitor in parallel with the load:

$$\epsfbox{00643x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00643}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{} {\bf Without capacitor}
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{line} =$ 48 A
\item{$\bullet$} P.F. = 0.829
\medskip

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{} {\bf With capacitor}
\item{$\bullet$} $I_{line} =$ 39.87 A
\item{$\bullet$} P.F. = 0.998
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: does the addition of the capacitor affect the amount of current through the 5 $\Omega$ load?  Why or why not?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answers to this question may seem really strange to students accustomed to DC circuit calculations, where parallel branch currents always add up to a {\it greater} total.  With complex numbers, however, the sum is not necessarily greater than the individual values!
