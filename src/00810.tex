How does Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction relate to the voltage output of a DC generator?  According to Faraday's Law, what factors can we alter to increase the voltage output by a DC generator?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Increase the ${d\phi \over dt}$ rate of change, or increase the number of turns in the armature winding.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to write the equation for Faraday's Law on the whiteboard, and then analyze it in a qualitative sense (with variables increasing or decreasing in value) to validate the answers.

The first answer to this question (increase ${d\phi \over dt}$) has been left purposefully vague, in order to make students think.  What, specifically, must be changed in order to increase this rate-of-change over time?  Which real-world variables are changeable after the generator has been manufactured, and which are not?
