Determine what input conditions are necessary to set, reset, and toggle these two J-K flip-flops:

$$\epsfbox{02936x01.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

For the J-K flip-flop with active-high inputs:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Set by . . .
\item{$\bullet$} Reset by . . .
\item{$\bullet$} Toggle by . . .
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

For the J-K flip-flop with active-low inputs:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Set by . . .
\item{$\bullet$} Reset by . . .
\item{$\bullet$} Toggle by . . .

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In {\it either} case, you cause the flip-flop to go into these three modes by doing the following:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Set by {\it activating} $J$, {\it deactivating} $K$, and {\it clocking} $C$.
\item{$\bullet$} Reset by {\it activating} $K$, {\it deactivating} $J$, and {\it clocking} $C$.
\item{$\bullet$} Toggle by {\it activating} $J$ and $K$ simultaneously, and {\it clocking} $C$.
\medskip

Specifically, though, here is what you would need to do to each flip-flop, stated in terms of "high" and "low" logic states:

\vskip 10pt

For the J-K flip-flop with active-high inputs:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Set by making $J$ high, $K$ low, and $C$ transition from low to high.
\item{$\bullet$} Reset by making $K$ high, $J$ low, and $C$ transition from low to high.
\item{$\bullet$} Toggle by making $J$ high, $K$ high, and $C$ transition from low to high.
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

For the J-K flip-flop with active-low inputs:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Set by making $K$ high, $J$ low, and $C$ transition from high to low.
\item{$\bullet$} Reset by making $J$ high, $K$ low, and $C$ transition from high to low.
\item{$\bullet$} Toggle by making $J$ low, $K$ low, and $C$ transition from high to low.
