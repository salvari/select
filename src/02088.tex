A series AC circuit exhibits a total impedance of 10 k$\Omega$, with a phase shift of 65 degrees between voltage and current.  Drawn in an impedance triangle, it looks like this:

$$\epsfbox{02088x01.eps}$$

We know that the {\it sine} function relates the sides $X$ and $Z$ of this impedance triangle with the 65 degree angle, because the sine of an angle is the ratio of {\it opposite} to {\it hypotenuse}, with $X$ being opposite the 65 degree angle.  Therefore, we know we can set up the following equation relating these quantities together:

$$\sin 65^o = {X \over Z}$$

Solve this equation for the value of $X$, in ohms.
