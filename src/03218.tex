Some AC induction motors are equipped with multiple windings so they may operate at two distinct speeds (low speed usually being one-half of high speed).  Shown here is the connection diagram for one type of two-speed motor:

$$\epsfbox{03218x01.eps}$$

There are six terminals on the motor itself where the connections are made:

$$\epsfbox{03218x02.eps}$$

The motor's datasheet will specify how the connections are to be made.  This is typical:

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

Explain why the motor runs at half-speed in one connection scheme and full speed in the other.  What is going on that makes this possible?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The difference between the two connection schemes is the polarity of three of the coils in relation to the other three.  This is called the {\it consequent pole} design of two-speed motor, where you essentially double the number of poles in the motor by reconnection.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Consequent pole motors are not the only design with multiple speeds.  Sometimes motors are wound with completely separate, multiple windings, which give them any combinations of speeds desired.
