%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out}$ = 2.593 V $\angle$ 61.3$^{o}$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very practical application of resistor-capacitor (RC) circuits: to introduce a phase shift to an AC signal.  Examples of where a circuit such as this may be used include oscillators (to introduce phase shift into a feedback network for a total phase shift of 360$^{o}$) and thyristor firing control circuits (phase-shifting the triggering voltage in relation to the source voltage).
