Your circuit will no doubt use a zener diode to establish the reference voltage.  The zener diode circuit itself (including the series "dropping" resistor) is incapable of supplying high current to a load.  How, then, does your circuit manage to supply at least {\it 2 amps} to the load, when using a zener voltage reference?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The zener reference circuit will have to be "followed" by a transistor amplifier of some sort.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Student designs will vary on this point, exactly how they boost the zener's low current output up to 2 amps.  Indeed, this is the real challenge of the design, to make a good amplifier for the task.
