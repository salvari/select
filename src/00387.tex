If the only instrument you had in your possession to detect AC voltage signals was an audio speaker, how could you use it to determine which of two AC voltage waveforms has the greatest period?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Connecting the speaker to each AC voltage source, one at a time, will result in two different audio tones output by the speaker.  Whichever tone is lower in pitch is the waveform with the greatest period.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

An audio speaker is an outstanding instrument to use in teaching AC theory, because it makes use of a human sense that most instruments do not.  I have constructed a simple headphone-based listening instrument for my own lab use, and have found it invaluable, especially in the absence of an oscilloscope.  There is so much the trained ear may discern about an AC waveform based on volume and tone!
