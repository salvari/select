Suppose I connect two resistors in parallel with one another, like this:

$$\epsfbox{01731x01.eps}$$

How much electrical resistance would you expect an ohmmeter to indicate if it were connected across the combination of these two parallel-connected resistors?

$$\epsfbox{01731x02.eps}$$

Explain the reasoning behind your answer, and try to formulate a generalization for all combinations of parallel resistances.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01731x03.eps}$$

Follow-up question: how much resistance would you expect the ohmmeter to register if there were {\it three} similarly-sized resistors connected in parallel instead of two?  What if there were {\it four} resistors?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The concept of parallel (total) resistance, in relation to individual resistances, often confuses new students.  Be sure to allow plenty of discussion time to work through the conceptual difficulties with them.
