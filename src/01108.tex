Determine both the waveshape and amplitude of the AC signal measured by the oscilloscope at the output of this circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01108x01.eps}$$

The diodes are model 1N4001, each.  The resistor's color code is Brown, Black, Orange, Silver.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The output will be a square wave with a peak-to-peak voltage of approximately 1.4 volts.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why the waveform will be {\it square} rather than {\it sinusoidal}.  Is it a perfect square-wave?  Why or why not?
