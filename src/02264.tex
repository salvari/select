RC phase-shift oscillator circuits may be constructed with different numbers of RC sections.  Shown here are schematic diagrams for three- and four-section RC oscillators:

$$\epsfbox{02264x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02264x02.eps}$$

What difference will the number of sections in the oscillator circuit make?  Be as specific as you can in your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The amount of phase shift per RC section will be different in each circuit, as well as the operating frequency (given the same $R$ and $C$ component values).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In either case, the point of the RC stages is to phase-shift the feedback signal by 180$^{o}$.  It is an over-simplification, though, to say that each stage in the three-section circuit shifts the signal by 60$^{}$, and/or that each stage in the four-section circuit shifts the signal by 45$^{o}$.  The amount of phase-shift in each section will not be equal (with equal $R$ and $C$ values) due to the loading of each section by the previous section(s).
