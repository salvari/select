Make a rough calculation of the power your circuit's final output transistor(s) must dissipate when carrying the full 2 amps of current.  Will the power dissipation be greatest at maximum voltage (20 volts) output or minimum voltage (3 volts) output?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The answer to this question may surprise you, being somewhat nonintuitive.  You may find that power dissipation is the most significant technical challenge to overcome in this circuit design: how to ensure your circuit will not be damaged by excessive heat.
