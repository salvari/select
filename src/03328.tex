%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$a = b - cd \hbox{\hskip 140pt} a = c^4 d^2 - b$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for $a$ in each equation.  Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.
