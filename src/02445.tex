Choose values for the collector and emitter resistors that will yield a voltage gain of approximately 5 for the following common-emitter amplifier circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02445x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $R_C$ =  
\item{$\bullet$} $R_E$ =  
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The following resistor values are but one solution for this problem.  There is actually an infinite number of correct resistor value pairs that will yield the requested voltage gain!

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $R_C$ = 10 k$\Omega$ 
\item{$\bullet$} $R_E$ = 2 k$\Omega$
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

You might want to ask your students what practical maximum and minimum resistor values they would choose between when designing such an amplifier circuit.  What would be the danger of selecting resistors too low in value?  What would be wrong with choosing resistors too high in value?  They might not be ready to answer these questions (especially the latter) until after having studied amplifier impedance calculations, though!
