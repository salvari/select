This square root extraction circuit used to work fine, but then one day it stopped outputting the square root of the input signal, and instead simply reproduced the input signal with a gain of 1:

$$\epsfbox{03805x01.eps}$$

What could have gone wrong with this circuit to cause it to stop "calculating" the square root of the input?  Be as detailed as possible in your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Possibly $R_2$ failed shorted or $R_3$ failed open.  I'll let you explain why either of these faults could cause the problem described.

One must understand what is happening in this circuit and why in order to successfully diagnose the problem.  Discuss this carefully with your students.
