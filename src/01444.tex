I'll let you research these terms on your own!  There are many technical references available on digital memory technology, so finding definitions for "address" and "data" should not be difficult.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Analogies are often helpful to communicate the concepts of "address" and "data" to new students.  I like to use the example of post office boxes (lots of addressed boxes, each containing different items) when I explain address and data.
