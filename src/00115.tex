From observation of this circuit (with components attached to a "terminal strip"), draw an appropriate schematic diagram:

This type of question is one that lends itself well to students drawing their answers on the board in front of class.  The skill of transferring a real circuit into a cleanly-drawn schematic is one that some students struggle mightily with, but it is important.  Those students will want to know what technique(s) may be used to make the transfer.  Students who are more spatially adept will probably have a couple of different ways to approach a problem such as this.  Allow them to explain to the rest of the class their technique(s) for tracing the real circuit's wiring into a schematic diagram.

Giving students the opportunity to teach their peers is a powerful instructional method, and should be encouraged at all times!
