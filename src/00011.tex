How could a battery, a light bulb, and some lengths of metal wire be used as a {\it conductivity tester}, to test the ability of different objects to conduct electricity?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The following circuit would function as a simple continuity tester.  Simply place the open wire ends in contact with the object to be tested, and the light bulb will indicate whether or not the object conducts electricity to any substantial degree:
