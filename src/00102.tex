%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One of my goals as a technical educator is to encourage the development of experimentation skills in my students.  The most accurate way to gain knowledge of a device's operation or of an electrical principle is to build a circuit that actually tests it.  I've used this technique many times in my career to further my knowledge on a subject, and it has proven to be an invaluable skill.

In this question, students are implicitly asked to identify several key things:

\vskip 10pt

\item {$\bullet$} Where to connect a meter to measure lamp voltage.
\item {$\bullet$} Where to connect a meter to measure lamp current.
\item {$\bullet$} How to make the current adjustable, so that multiple values may be tested and plotted.

\vskip 10pt

Additionally, the students must identify what voltage/current ranges will be necessary to test a gas-discharge lamp.  Notice the high-voltage power source shown in the schematic diagram.  Students may ask "How high must this voltage be?" upon seeing the schematic in the answer.  Don't tell them outright.  Rather, have them do some research and report the next day on typical lamp voltages!
