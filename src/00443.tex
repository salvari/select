Design a circuit with a three-position switch, where one position charges a capacitor, one position holds the capacitor's voltage constant, and the last position discharges the capacitor.  Provide independent, variable adjustments for charging and discharging time constants.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The following circuit does not meet all the design criteria, but it gives you an idea of where to begin in your design:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is an interesting question, as the students are challenged with the design of a circuit, and that the example circuit shown in the answer does not completely fulfill the specified criteria.  In order for a student to derive a circuit from the one given in the answer, they must first assess that circuit's operation, to determine what it can and cannot do.

Note that it will not suffice to merely replace the fixed-value resistor with a variable resistor, as this would not provide {\it independent} adjustment of charging and discharging time constants.
