Calculate all component voltage drops in this circuit, assuming a supply voltage of 15 volts, an emitter-base forward voltage drop of 0.7 volts, and a (saturated) emitter-collector voltage drop of 0.3 volts:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

An interesting point that some students may bring up is the 0.4 volt drop across the base-collector junction.  Attentive students will note that this junction is supposed to be reverse-biased, but Kirchhoff's Voltage Law clearly specifies the polarity of that 0.4 volt drop, and it is in the direction one would expect for {\it forward biasing} of that junction.  An examination of the energy diagram for a conducting bipolar junction transistor is really necessary to explain why that junction is considered to be reverse-biased.
