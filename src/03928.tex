Calculate the DC voltage at each test point (with reference to ground), and also between test points TP1 and TP2 in this operational amplifier circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03928x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP1}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP2}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP3}$ =
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP1-TP2}$ =

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP1}$ = -3.3 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP2}$ = -3.3 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP3}$ = -3.3 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{TP1-TP2}$ = 0 volts
