%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The most basic definition for this device should be obvious: a circuit that takes a digital input and creates an analog output.  What I'm looking for, though, is something a little less obvious.  In your own words, explain what it means for a circuit to have a "digital input" and an "analog output."  You may give an example of such a circuit if you find it easier to answer the question in context.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Informational sources abound which your students can research.  Be sure to ask them to answer specifically, explaining what it means for a circuit to have a "digital input" and an "analog output."
