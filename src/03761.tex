Determine the output voltage polarity of this op-amp (with reference to ground), given the following input conditions:

$$\epsfbox{03761x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 03761}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In these illustrations, I have likened the op-amp's action to that of a single-pole, double-throw switch, showing the "connection" made between power supply terminals and the output terminal.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Determining which "way" the output of an op-amp drives under different input voltage conditions is confusing to many students.  Discuss this with them, and ask them to present any principles or analogies they use to remember "which way is which."
