Your project is to design and build a signal generator, using an integrated circuit dedicated to this purpose.  I recommend using either the Harris 8038 or the Maxim MAX038CPP.  Complete schematic diagrams for signal generator circuits may be found on the respective datasheets for these devices.

The signal generator must be powered by AC from the line, so it needs to have its own regulated AC-DC power supply!  Signal frequency and amplitude must be independently adjustable, ideally with "coarse" and "fine" adjustments for frequency.  Your circuit must be able to output sine, square, and triangle wave signals, either selectable or simultaneous outputs.
