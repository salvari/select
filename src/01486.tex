Two technicians are arguing over the function of a component in this oscillator circuit.  Capacitor $C_1$ has failed, and they are debating over the proper value of its replacement.

$$\epsfbox{01486x01.eps}$$

One technician argues that the value of capacitor $C_1$ helps set the oscillation frequency of the circuit, and that the value of the replacement capacitor therefore must be precisely matched to the value of the original.  The other technician thinks its value is not critical at all, arguing that all it does is help to provide a stable DC power supply voltage.  What do you think?

Also, describe the purpose of this circuit: what is it?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This circuit is a simple "CW" radio transmitter, used to broadcast information using Morse code.

The second technician is closer to the truth than the first, with regard to the capacitor.  $C_1$ is not part of the oscillator's resonant network, and so does not set the oscillation frequency.  However, if the replacement capacitor's value is too far from the original's value, this circuit will not start and stop oscillating as "crisply" as it did before, when the code key switch is repeatedly actuated.

Ask your students how they can tell that $C_1$ is not part of the oscillator's resonant network.
