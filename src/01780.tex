Size both resistors in this voltage divider circuit to provide 6 volts to the load, assuming that the load will draw 7 mA of current at this voltage, and to have a "bleeder" current of 1 mA going through $R_2$:

$$\epsfbox{01780x01.eps}$$

As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of both resistors.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1 = 750 \> \Omega$ and $R_2 = 6 \hbox{ k}\Omega$.  $1 \over 8$ watt resistors are perfectly adequate to handle the dissipations in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This may seem like a tricky problem to some students, as though it is lacking in information.  All the necessary information is there, however.  Students just need to think through all the laws of series-parallel circuits to piece together the necessary resistor values from the given specifications.
