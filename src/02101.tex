Phasors may be symbolically described in two different ways: {\it polar notation} and {\it rectangular notation}.  Explain what each of these notations means, and why either one may adequately describe a phasor.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Polar notation describes a phasor in terms of magnitude (length) and angle:

$$\epsfbox{02101x01.eps}$$

Rectangular notation describes a phasor in terms of horizontal and vertical displacement:

$$\epsfbox{02101x02.eps}$$

Follow-up question: why do we need the letter $j$ in rectangular notation?  What purpose does it serve, and what does it mean?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

When discussing the meaning of $j$, it might be good to explain what {\it imaginary numbers} are.  Whether or not you choose to do this depends on the mathematical aptitude and background of your students.
