%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The transistor serves to "boost" the current-sourcing capability of the resistor/zener voltage regulator circuit, to provide far more current to a load than possible with the resistor/zener alone.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to identify the configuration of this transistor amplifier (common-base, common-emitter, or common collector?).  After they have done this, ask them to identify the current gain of such an amplifier, given a transistor $\beta$ value of 90.
