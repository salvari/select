Write the Boolean expression for each of these logic gates, showing how the output ($Q$) algebraically relates to the inputs ($A$ and $B$):

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order to familiarize students with Boolean algebra and how it relates to logic gate circuitry, I like to give them daily practice with questions such as this.  Students need to be able to recognize these logic gate types at a glance, and also be able to associate the proper Boolean expression with each one, or else they will have difficulty analyzing logic circuits later on.
