Determine the inductance of the inductor in this circuit, given the phase shift displayed by the oscilloscope between inductor voltage ($V_{TP2}$) and total voltage ($V_{TP1}$):

$$\epsfbox{03583x01.eps}$$

Base your answer purely on the phase shift displayed on the oscilloscope screen, not the amplitude or the period.  In other words, consider the volts/division and seconds/division settings to be uncalibrated.
