%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question asks students to identify those variables in each circuit that vectorially {\it add}, discriminating them from those variables which do not add.  This is extremely important for students to be able to do if they are to successfully apply "the triangle" to the solution of AC circuit problems.

Note that some of these triangles should be drawn upside-down instead of all the same as they are shown in the question, if we are to properly represent the vertical (imaginary) phasor for capacitive impedance and for inductor admittance.  However, the point here is simply to get students to recognize what quantities add and what do not.  Attention to the direction (up or down) of the triangle's opposite side can come later.
