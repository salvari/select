The following circuit is sometimes referred to as a {\it polarity separator}.  Invent some test conditions you would use to "prove" the operation of the circuit, then analyze the circuit under those imagined conditions and see what the results are:

$$\epsfbox{02557x01.eps}$$

Explain what each output does in this "polarity separator" circuit for any given input voltage.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The $V_{out1}$ output is the inverse (negative) of any positive input voltage, while the $V_{out2}$ output is the inverse (positive) of any negative input voltage.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This circuit is a good introduction to the full-wave precision rectifier circuit, although its operation there is a bit more difficult to understand than it is here.
