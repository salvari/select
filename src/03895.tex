Identify at least one component fault that would cause the flip-flop to indicate "clockwise" all the time, regardless of encoder motion:

$$\epsfbox{03895x01.eps}$$

For each of your proposed faults, explain {\it why} it will cause the described problem.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Phototransistor $Q_1$ failed shorted.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ failed open.
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Flipflop $U_1$ output failed high.
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain why the presence of ambient light near the phototransistors could also cause this problem to occur.

Be sure to discuss with your students the reasons why their proposed faults would cause the stated problem.
