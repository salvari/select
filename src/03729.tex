Predict how the operation of this UJT latch circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03729x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_1$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_2$:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails open: {\it Neither pushbutton switch has any effect on the LED.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted: {\it Circuit behaves normally.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it LED always off, refuses to turn on.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_1$: {\it LED always on, refuses to turn off.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it LED always on, refuses to turn off.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_2$: {\it LED always off, refuses to turn on.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
