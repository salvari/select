Calculate the output voltage of this passive differentiator circuit 150 microseconds after the rising edge of each "clock" pulse (where the square wave transitions from 0 volts to +5 volts):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out}$ = 1.172 volts @ 150 $\mu$s after rising edge

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is nothing more than an exercise in time-constant circuit calculations: determining how far the output voltage has decayed from its peak of 5 volts after 150 $\mu$s.  Ask your students to share their techniques for problem-solving with the whole class.
