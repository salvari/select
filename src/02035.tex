Explain in your own words how to apply the {\it Superposition Theorem} to calculate the amount of current through the load resistor in this circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02035x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

To apply the Superposition Theorem to the analysis of $R_{load}$'s current, you must consider each source acting alone, then algebraically combine the results of each analysis.

\vskip 10pt

$I_{load} = $ 6.623 mA 

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here is a circuit students will not be able to analyze by series-parallel analysis, since it is impossible to reduce all the resistors in it to a single equivalent resistance.  It is cases like this that really showcase the power of Superposition as an analysis technique.
