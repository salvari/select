This circuit generates a pulse of DC voltage sufficient to energize the neon lamp, every time the switch is opened:

$$\epsfbox{01100x01.eps}$$

Describe the principle of operation for this simple circuit, and also how it could be modified to produce {\it continuous high-voltage} DC power.

\vskip 10pt

Hint: how does a common AC-DC power supply circuit convert {\it pulses} of rectified DC into a relatively "smooth" DC output?

Follow-up question: how would you recommend we "automate" this circuit so that a person does not have to keep pressing and releasing the switch for it to generate a continuous DC output voltage?

Ask your students to explain their solutions for "automating" the switch's action.  Prepare yourself for some creative answers!
