This relaxation oscillator circuit uses a resistor-capacitor combination ($R_1$ - $C_1$) to establish the time delay between output pulses:

$$\epsfbox{01186x01.eps}$$

The voltage measured between TP1 and ground looks like this on the oscilloscope display:

$$\epsfbox{01186x02.eps}$$

A slightly different version of this circuit adds a JFET to the capacitor's charge current path:

$$\epsfbox{01186x03.eps}$$

Now, the voltage at TP1 looks like this:

$$\epsfbox{01186x04.eps}$$

What function does the JFET perform in this circuit, based on your analysis of the new TP1 signal waveform?  The straight-line charging voltage pattern shown on the second oscilloscope display indicates what the JFET is doing in this circuit.  

Hint: you don't need to know anything about the function of the unijunction transistor (at the circuit's output) other than it acts as an on/off switch to periodically discharge the capacitor when the TP1 voltage reaches a certain threshold level.

Challenge question: write a formula predicting the {\it slope} of the ramping voltage waveform measured at TP1.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The JFET in this circuit functions as a constant current regulator.

Answer to challenge question: Slope = $dv \over dt$ = ${I_D \over C}$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students how they would know to relate "constant current" to the peculiar charging action of this capacitor.  Ask them to explain this mathematically.

Then, ask them to explain exactly how the JFET works to regulate charging current.

Note: the schematic diagram for this circuit was derived from one found on page 958 of John Markus' \underbar{Guidebook of Electronic Circuits}, first edition.  Apparently, the design originated from a Motorola publication on using unijunction transistors ("Unijunction Transistor Timers and Oscillators," AN-294, 1972).
