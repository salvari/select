Think of a way to re-wire the electrical system of this old automobile (with 6-volt light bulbs) so as to not require resistors between the loads and the generator/battery portion of the circuit (operating at 12 volts each).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Connect the light bulb pairs in series instead of parallel.  This way, each light bulb will receive 6 volts, with a total system voltage of 12 volts.

Follow-up question: there is a disadvantage of this strategy, though, and it concerns the safety of operating the automobile.  Explain what this disadvantage is.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This solution works only because the load sets are in pairs, and because 6 + 6 = 12.  One benefit of this solution is greater efficiency, as there are no resistors in the circuit to "waste" power by dissipating it in the form of heat.  However, there is a disadvantage to doing things this way, as indicated by the follow-up question.  Discuss this disadvantage with your students, reinforcing the idea that the most efficient engineering solutions may not be the best when assessed from other perspectives, such as safety!
