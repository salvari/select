An {\it oscilloscope} is a very useful piece of electronic test equipment.  Most everyone has seen an oscilloscope in use, in the form of a heart-rate monitor (electrocardiogram, or EKG) of the type seen in doctor's offices and hospitals.

When monitoring heart beats, what do the two axes (horizontal and vertical) of the oscilloscope screen represent?

In general electronics use, when measuring AC voltage signals, what do the two axes (horizontal and vertical) of the oscilloscope screen represent?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

EKG vertical = {\it heart muscle contraction} ; EKG horizontal = {\it time}

General-purpose vertical = {\it voltage} ; General-purpose horizontal = {\it time}

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Oscilloscope function is often best learned through interaction.  Be sure to have at least one oscilloscope operational in the classroom for student interaction during discussion time.
