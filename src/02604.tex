%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Unity-Gain Bandwidth is the frequency at which an operational amplifier's open-loop voltage gain is equal to 1.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It does not require a great deal of insight to recognize that unity-gain bandwidth ($B_1$) and gain-bandwidth product (GBW) are pretty much the same thing.  This would be a good point to bring up (in the form of a question!) for your students if you have already discussed GBW.
