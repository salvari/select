Capacitors tend to oppose change in voltage, and so they may be considered "temporary voltage sources."  That is, they tend to hold a constant voltage over time, but they cannot do so indefinitely.  Any motion of charge (current) will change the voltage of a capacitor.

Likewise, inductors may be considered "temporary current sources" because while they tend to hold current constant over time, they cannot do so indefinitely.  Any application of voltage across a (perfect) inductor will alter the amount of current going through it.

Given the above characterizations, determine what resistance levels will result in the {\it fastest} discharge of energy for both the capacitive circuit and the inductive circuit.  Considering each of the reactive components ($C$ and $L$, respectively) as "temporary" power sources whose store of energy will drain over time, determine what value of $R$ in each circuit will result in the quickest depletion of energy by making each source "work hardest:"

Based on your answer to this question, explain how circuit resistance ($R$) affects the time constants ($\tau$) of RC and of LR circuits.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I will answer this question with another question: what value of $R$ in each of these circuits will result in the greatest power dissipation at the load, large $R$ or small $R$?

$$\epsfbox{03526x02.eps}$$

Large $R$ values slow down RC circuits and speed up LR circuits, while small $R$ values speed up RC circuits and slow down LR circuits.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The leap I expect students to make here is to think about the exchange of energy for both capacitors and inductors as they deliver power to a resistive load.  Which ever values of $R$ make the respective sources work the hardest (dissipate the most power at the load) will be the values that make the reactive components discharge quickest.
