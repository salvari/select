Calculate the necessary resistor value ($R_1$) in this circuit to give it a voltage gain of 15:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1$ = 1.467 k$\Omega$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students how they solved this problem, especially since it is fairly safe to say that they didn't find the equation directly solving for $R_1$ in any book.  Algebraic manipulation is necessary to take the standard voltage gain equation and put it into a form suitable for use answering this question.
