Compare and contrast inverting versus noninverting amplifier circuits constructed using operational amplifiers:

$$\epsfbox{02469x01.eps}$$

How do these two general forms of opamp circuit compare, especially in regard to input impedance and the range of voltage gain adjustment?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The noninverting configuration exhibits a far greater input impedance than the inverting amplifier, but has a more limited range of voltage gain: always greater than or equal to unity.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Just a simple comparison between amplifier configurations, nothing more.  Ask your students to elaborate on the inverting amplifier's range of gain adjustment: how does it differ from the noninverting configuration?
