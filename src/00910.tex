$$\epsfbox{00910x01.eps}$$

{\it Note: $E_f$ represents the Fermi energy level, and not a voltage.  In physics, $E$ always stands for energy and $V$ for electric potential (voltage).}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here it is very important that students understand the effects an electric field has on energy bands.
