Explain how this battery charger circuit uses a TRIAC to control {\it DC} power to the battery:

$$\epsfbox{02148x01.eps}$$

Also, identify some component failures in this circuit that could prevent DC power from getting to the battery.

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The TRIAC controls power to the primary winding of the step-down transformer.  Afterward, that AC power is rectified to DC for charging purposes.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The interesting point of this circuit is that by controlling AC power with the TRIAC, DC power to the battery is subsequently controlled.  

Ask your students to explain the purpose of each component in the circuit, and pose some troubleshooting questions for them to analyze.  There are many possibilities for component failures stopping DC power from getting to the battery.  Discuss the examples your students think of, and determine the relatively likelihood of each.
