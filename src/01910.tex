How will the oscilloscope trigger if the control is set to {\it Line} source rather than {\bf A} or {\bf B} inputs:

$$\epsfbox{01910x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In this mode, the oscilloscope triggers off the power-line waveform.

Follow-up question: what circumstance can you think of that would require this triggering source?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

"Line" triggering is a very useful feature, especially for working on line-powered and line-synchronized circuits.  SCR- and TRIAC-based motor control circuits come immediately to mind here, as do brute-force (linear) power supply circuits!
