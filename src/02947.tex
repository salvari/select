%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One lesson of digital circuits many students learn the hard way is the importance of not leaving CMOS inputs floating.  In this case, the lesson is often learned in the form of leaving asynchronous inputs of the J-K flip-flops floating (preset, clear, or both).  Be sure to check to see that all chip inputs are accounted for before passing students on this competency.  If you see an input floating, touch the chip pin with a pen or pencil and let your students see the effect static has on their circuit!
