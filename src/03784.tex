Which component, the resistor or the capacitor, will drop more voltage in this circuit?

$$\epsfbox{03784x01.eps}$$

Also, calculate the total impedance ($Z_{total}$) of this circuit, expressing it in both rectangular and polar forms.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The resistor will drop more voltage.

\vskip 10pt

$Z_{total}$ (rectangular form) = 5100 $\Omega$ - j4671 $\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$Z_{total}$ (polar form) = 6916 $\Omega$ $\angle$ -42.5$^{o}$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students how they were able to make the determination of greater voltage drop.  Which method yields the fastest solution (i.e. requires the fewest steps)?
