%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although the model 741 operational amplifier is considered obsolete by many modern standards, it is still a suitable circuit for this kind of exploration with students.  Being able to look over a schematic diagram and figure out what the components do is an important troubleshooting skill.  The fact that human circuit designers tend to repeat specific circuit elements and "modules" (such as the common-collector amplifier or the current mirror) in their designs rather than invent something completely novel for each design simplifies the task of later interpretation.
