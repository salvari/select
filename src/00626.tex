Magnetic poles are designated by two labels: "North" and "South".  How are these labels defined?  Explain how we can experimentally determine which ends of a magnet are "North" and "South", respectively?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The end of a magnet that points to the north pole of the Earth is called the "North" pole of the magnet.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

After your students explain how to experimentally determine the poles of a magnet, challenge them with this question: given that like poles repel and opposite poles attract, what are the proper magnetic pole designations for the Earth's actual poles?  If the "north" end of a bar magnet orients itself so that it is geographically pointing north, what "magnetic polarity" does the actual North pole of the Earth have?
