Follow-up question: can you think of any disadvantages of active probes?  In other words, reasons why an old-fashioned passive probe would be a better choice than an active probe for signal measurement?

One place your students might wish to research in answering this question is a technical specifications page for different oscilloscope probes.  By comparing the specs of active versus passive probes, the advantages (and disadvantages) should become evident.
