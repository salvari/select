Simplify this logic gate circuit, which uses nothing but NOR gates to accomplish a certain logic function:

$$\epsfbox{02803x01.eps}$$

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02803x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question stands as an example of how NOR gates may be used to construct different types of logic functions.  In fact, with a sufficient quantity of NOR gates, {\it any} logic function may be built.  This is why NOR gates are said to be "universal."
