An inductive AC load consumes 15.2 MW of true power at a voltage of 115 kV and 149.8 amps.  If the system frequency is 50 Hz, calculate the following:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Apparent power ($S$) =
\item{$\bullet$} Reactive power ($Q$) =
\item{$\bullet$} Power factor =
\item{$\bullet$} $\Theta$ =
\item{$\bullet$} Necessary parallel $C$ size to correct power factor to unity =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Apparent power ($S$) = 17.23 MVA
\item{$\bullet$} Reactive power ($Q$) = 8.107 MVAR
\item{$\bullet$} Power factor = 0.882
\item{$\bullet$} $\Theta$ = 28.1$^{o}$
\item{$\bullet$} Necessary parallel $C$ size to correct power factor to unity = 1.951 $\mu$F
