Are fuses and circuit breakers located at a power distribution panel rated to protect the wiring from overcurrent, or to protect the load devices from overcurrent?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Generally speaking, distribution panel overcurrent protection devices are rated in such a way as to protect the wiring, not the load devices.

Follow-up question: suppose a computer with a 300 watt power supply is plugged into a receptacle, which is serviced by a circuit breaker rated at 15 amps.  Where in the circuit would it be best to install an overcurrent protection device for protecting the computer from burning itself up in the event of an internal failure?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This lesson is very important for students to learn: that panel-mounted overcurrent protection devices are rated to protect the wiring they supply power to, and nothing else.  Of course, there are exceptions to this rule in large industrial power systems.
