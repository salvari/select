Explain how an analog ammeter could be used to measure the current output of the generator in this circuit, as it charges the two batteries and energizes the three light bulbs.  Be sure to connect the ammeter in the circuit in such a way that the meter needle does not drive "downscale"!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

To measure generator output current, remove the fuse and connect the ammeter test leads to the two "clips" of the empty fuse holder, the red lead on the clip connecting to the generator, and the black lead on the clip connecting to the battery.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to reinforce the safety aspects of this task.  Although the primary focus of this question is most definitely Kirchhoff's Current Law, that is no excuse to avoid discussing electrical safety!
