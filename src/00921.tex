The "1N400x" series of rectifying diodes are very popular for low-current applications.  By "1N400x," I mean the 1N4001, 1N4002, 1N4003, . . . 1N4007.  Only one parameter differs between these different diode models.  What parameter is this, and what is its significance?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Only the {\it reverse} (or {\it blocking}) voltage rating differs between these diode models.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to ask your students where they found the information on these different diode models!

Discuss with your students the importance of this rating, and why a person might choose the 1N4007 diode for an application rather than the 1N4001, for instance.
