What is the difference between a JMP ("jump") instruction and a CALL ("call") instruction?  Where might each type of branching command be used?  Hint: one of these is used to execute a {\it subroutine}.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A JMP instruction simply tells the microprocessor to "jump" to a specified address.  A CALL instruction similarly redirects program flow to a specified address, but remembers its place so the program may "return" where it left off.

Discuss the concept of a {\it subroutine} with your students, and how subroutines economize program size.
