Calculate the amount of power supplied by the source in each of these circuits:

$$\epsfbox{01880x01.eps}$$

What do you notice about these two circuits that is interesting?  How much impedance does each source "think" it is supplying power to, based on the following formula?

$$Z = {V_{source} \over I_{source}}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In each case, the source outputs the same amount of current, which means it "sees" the same impedance.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I like using specific numerical examples to introduce the concept of impedance transformation, because I find abstract mathematical presentations tend to "lose" a lot of students.
