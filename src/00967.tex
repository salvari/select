Explain how you could {\it measure} the AC voltage gain of a functioning Class A amplifier circuit, as opposed to {\it predicting} its gain from known component values.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Measuring input and output voltage with an AC voltmeter or oscilloscope:

$$A_V = {V_{out} \over V_{in}}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This skill is important if students are to build amplifier circuits and empirically compare their performance against predicted results.
