An important performance parameter for amplifier circuits is {\it bandwidth}.  Explain what "bandwidth" means, and what factor(s) limit the bandwidth for electronic amplifiers.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Bandwidth is the measure of the signal frequency {\it range} that an amplifier can effectively handle while maintaining usable gain:

Rolloff at the high-frequency end is largely due to the Miller effect, while rolloff at the low-frequency end is usually due to coupling capacitors in the circuit.

If the graph given in the answer reminds students of a band-pass filter, then they have been paying attention!
