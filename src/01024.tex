Determine the output voltage of this circuit for two different input voltage values: +5 volts, and -5 volts, assuming the use of ordinary silicon rectifying diodes:

$$\epsfbox{01024x01.eps}$$

Based on this data (and any other input conditions you wish to test this circuit under), describe what the function of this circuit is.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

When $V_{in} =$ +5 volts, $V_{out} =$ -5 volts

\vskip 10pt

When $V_{in} =$ -5 volts, $V_{out} =$ 0 volts

\vskip 10pt

This circuit is a precision rectifier.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Work with your students to analyze the behavior of this circuit, using Ohm's Law and the basic principle of negative feedback (zero differential input voltage).  Ask your students whether or not it matters what types of diodes are used (silicon versus germanium versus light-emitting).
