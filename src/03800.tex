Suppose this LC oscillator stopped working, and you suspected either the capacitor or the inductor as having failed.  How could you check these two components {\it without} the use of an LCR meter?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Try using an ohmmeter on each component, removed from the circuit.  The capacitor should read "open" and the inductor should read a low resistance, if both are in good condition.

Follow-up question: is an ohmmeter test comprehensive enough to detect all possible faults with these two types of components?  Why or why not?  Be as specific as you can in your answer(s).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Knowing how to check the condition of components with primitive test equipment is a valuable skill.  It is well worth your time to discuss this question (and its answers) with your students in detail, so they all understand the concepts involved.
