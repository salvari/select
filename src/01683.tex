The Q factor of a series inductive circuit is given by the following equation:

$$Q = {X_L \over R_{series}}$$

Likewise, we know that inductive reactance may be found by the following equation:

$$X_L = 2 \pi f L$$

We also know that the resonant frequency of a series LC circuit is given by this equation:

$$f_r = {1 \over {2 \pi \sqrt{LC}}}$$

Through algebraic substitution, write an equation that gives the Q factor of a series resonant LC circuit exclusively in terms of $L$, $C$, and $R$, without reference to reactance ($X$) or frequency ($f$).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$Q = {1 \over R} \sqrt{L \over C}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is merely an exercise in algebra.  However, knowing how these three component values affects the Q factor of a resonant circuit is a valuable and practical insight!
