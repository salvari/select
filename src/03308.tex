A passive integrator circuit is energized by a square wave signal with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 12 volts and a frequency of 65.79 Hz:

$$\epsfbox{03308x01.eps}$$

Determine the peak-to-peak voltage of the output waveform:

$$\epsfbox{03308x02.eps}$$

Hint: the output waveform will be centered exactly half-way between the two peaks of the input square wave as shown in the oscilloscope image.  Do {\it not} base your answer on relative sizes of the two waveforms, as I have purposely skewed the calibration of the oscilloscope screen image so the two waveforms are not to scale with each other.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out}$ (peak-to-peak) = 8.025 volts

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: the components comprising this circuit are improperly sized if it is actually expected to function as a reasonably accurate {\it integrator}.  Suggest better component values for the frequency of signal being integrated.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: write a formula that solves for this peak-to-peak output voltage ($V_{out}$) given the peak-to-peak input voltage ($V_{in}$), resistor value $R$, capacitor value $C$, and signal frequency $f$.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is an interesting problem to set up.  Ask your students what approach they used, so they all can see multiple problem-solving techniques.  I based my own solution on the RC circuit decay equation $e^{-t / \tau}$ with $x$ volts being my starting condition and -6 volts being my final condition (if time $t$ is infinite), then I just solved for $x$.  With my method, $x$ is the peak signal voltage, not the peak-to-peak, so I just doubled it to get the final answer.

$$\epsfbox{03308x03.eps}$$

My own answer for the challenge question is this:

$$V_{out} = {{V_{in}\left(1 - e^{-1 \over 2RCf}\right)} \over {1 + e^{-1 \over 2RCf}}}$$

Your mileage may vary . . .
