What would happen to the voltage drops across each resistor in this circuit if resistor R1 were to fail open?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If resistor R1 were to fail open (internally), it would drop the full battery voltage across its terminals, leaving no voltage for R2 or R3.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In most DC circuit failure scenarios, the effects of open or short faults may be estimated or even precisely predicted without having to perform any mathematical calculations.  Of course, you could calculate the effects by using extremely large values for open resistors and 0 for shorted resistors, but that would be an inefficient use of time!
