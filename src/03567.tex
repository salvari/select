Calculate the total voltage for these series-connected AC voltage sources, assuming they are both at the same frequency ($f$):

$$\epsfbox{03567x01.eps}$$

You do not have to express an angle for the total voltage, only a magnitude (how many volts).  Show your work, as well as a phasor diagram showing how the total voltage relates to the two source voltages.
