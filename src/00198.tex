Suppose two 33 $\mu$F capacitors are connected in series with each other.  What will their combined capacitance be, in Farads?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

16.5 $\mu$F

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Capacitors often confuse new students of electronics because their values do not add up the same as resistors.  It is important in answering this question that your students understand {\it why} series capacitances combine as they do.  There is more than one way to explain this phenomenon -- explain in terms of capacitor dimensions, or in terms of voltage drop and charge storage.
