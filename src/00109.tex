Electric current is measured in the unit of the {\it ampere}, or {\it amp}.  What is the physical definition for this unit?  What fundamental quantities constitute 1 ampere of electric current?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

1 ampere of electric current is the rate of electron motion equal to 1 coulomb per second:

$$I = {Q \over t}$$

\noindent
Where,

$I =$ Electric current (amperes)

$Q =$ Charge in motion (coulombs)

$t =$ Time (seconds)

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It may be helpful at this point to review the number of electrons constituting one coulomb of charge: $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

Technically, current's mathematical definition involves calculus:

$$I = {dQ \over dt}$$

However, students at this stage may not be ready to explore derivatives yet, and so the equation give in the answer for (average) current will suffice.
