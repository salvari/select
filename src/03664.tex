An electronics student builds an amplified CD (stereo) player, but needs to find the correct transformers to impedance-match the 16 $\Omega$ speakers to the 1 k$\Omega$ amplifier outputs for maximum power output:

$$\epsfbox{03664x01.eps}$$

Calculate the necessary winding turns ratio ($N_p \over N_s$) for these transformers, and also the number of secondary turns necessary (rounded to the nearest whole turn) if the primary winding of each has 2100 turns:

\vskip 10pt

Turns ratio ($N_p \over N_s$) = \hskip 150pt Secondary turns ($N_s$) = 

\underbar{file 03664}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Turns ratio ($N_p \over N_s$) = 7.91 : 1 \hskip 100pt Secondary turns ($N_s$) = 266
