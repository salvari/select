%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The motor would spin in one direction, with a pulsing torque.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: identify the polarity of the DC voltage between the motor terminals.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why the motor's torque pulsates instead of being steady as it would be when powered by a battery.  Is this necessarily a bad thing?  How does the motor's speed compare with being powered by a DC source of the same (RMS-equivalent) voltage?
