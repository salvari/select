%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f$ = 929 Hz

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Phase-shifting circuits are very useful, and important to understand.  They are particularly important in some types of oscillator circuits, which rely on RC networks such as this to provide certain phase shifts to sustain oscillation.
