Determine the output pulses for this counter circuit, known as a {\it Johnson counter}, assuming that all $Q$ outputs begin in the low state:

$$\epsfbox{01427x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{01427x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01427}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01427x03.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: if used as a frequency divider, what is the input:output ratio of this circuit?  How difficult would it be to design a Johnson counter with a different division ratio?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students how Johnson counters are quite different from binary-sequence counters, and how this uniqueness allows certain counting functions to be implemented much easier (using fewer gates) than other types of counter circuits.
