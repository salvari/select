Calculate the value of resistor $R_3$ needed to balance this bridge circuit, given the following resistance values:

$$\epsfbox{03429x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $R_1$ = 1.9 k$\Omega$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $R_2$ = 2.5 k$\Omega$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $R_3$ = 
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $R_4$ = 1 k$\Omega$
\medskip

Also, write an equation showing how these four resistor values relate to one another in a condition of balance.
