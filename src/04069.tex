The equation relating probability of continued performance for a component or a system versus time may be expressed as follows:

$$x = e^{-t / m}$$

\noindent
Where,

$x$ = Probability (a number between 0 and 1, inclusive)

$e$ = Euler's constant ($\approx$ 2.7182818)

$t$ = Time of continuous operation

$m$ = Mean Time Between Failure of the component or system

\vskip 10pt

The unit of time for both $t$ and $m$ must be the same.  That is, if $t$ is measured in years, then $m$ must also be expressed in years or else the equation will give very misleading answers.

Suppose, though, we were given $m$ in years, and the operating time $t$ in {\bf days}.  Substitute the relationship $t_d = 365 t_y$ into the reliability equation so that we will have a new equation that can take $t$ in days ($t_d$) and $m$ in years, and still provide the correct answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$x = e^{-t_d / 365 m}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is really nothing more than a simple exercise in mathematical substitution.

The equation came from the {\it Standard Handbook of Engineering Calculations} by Tyler G Hicks, P.E. (1972), page 5-21.
