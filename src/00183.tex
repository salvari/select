A DC electric motor transforms 1.75 kW of electrical power into mechanical form.  If the motor's operating voltage is 300 volts, how much current does it "draw" when operating at full load (full power output)?

Also calculate the motor's output power in units of {\it horsepower}, assuming 100\% efficiency.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Motor current = 5.833 amps.  Motor power = 2.346 horsepower.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

To answer both parts of this question, students will have to apply Ohm's (Joule's) Law to calculate power from figures of voltage and current, and they will also have to research the conversion factor between watts and horsepower.
