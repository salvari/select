After experimenting some with this intercom circuit, you will find that there is a point on the volume control below which so little sound is reproduced that it is almost useless, and a point above which there is substantial distortion.  Explain how you could place "stops" to limit the volume control range so that the user could not adjust past these points, making the volume control more useful.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Place "stop" resistors before and after the potentiometer, sized appropriately to limit the minimum and maximum volumes to whatever levels are desired:

$$\epsfbox{02747x01.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This technique is frequently used to "bound" the range of a potentiometer within a pair of desired limits.  For a circuit such as this, the only way to really determine where the upper and lower limits are is by experimenting.
