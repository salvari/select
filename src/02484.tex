Explain what it means for a transistor to operate in its "active" mode (as opposed to cutoff, saturation, or breakdown).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In the active mode, a transistor "throttles" current somewhere between being fully off and fully on.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Help your students contrast active transistor operation with what they know of transistors as switching elements (either saturated or cut off).  Ask them to explain what is unique about transistor behavior in the active region that is not exhibited in any other region (i.e. the transistor's behavior with regard to collector current and collector-emitter voltage).
