The simplest form of AM radio receiver is the so-called {\it crystal} receiver circuit.  It gets its name from the very early days of solid-state electronics, when crude signal rectifying diodes were constructed from certain types of mineral crystals:

Explain how the AM radio signal becomes "demodulated" into an audio-frequency signal, through the clipping action of the diode.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This simple AM "detector" circuit is widely discussed in basic electronics textbooks and other technical literature.  There is little I can say here that would expand on what is already written about these circuits.  I leave it to you to do the research!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain the purpose of each component in the "crystal" radio circuit, not just those components related to the clipping function.
