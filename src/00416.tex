%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Polyphase AC voltages are usually created by special alternators, with different "phase" windings spaced around the circumference of the stator.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

An illustration of polyphase alternator construction would be excellent to aid understanding of this concept.  Your students should have no trouble finding illustrations of three-phase alternator design from textbooks and from the internet.
