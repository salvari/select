Calculate the approximate output voltage of this regulated power supply circuit, the amount of current through the zener diode, and the (unregulated) voltage across the 1000 $\mu$F capacitor, all under no-load conditions:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out} \approx$ 6.2 V \hskip 30pt $I_{zener} \approx$ 25.6 mA \hskip 30pt $V_{capacitor}$ = 32.5 V

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Calculating the output voltage is a much simpler task than calculating the zener diode's current!  Have your students explain their problem-solving techniques for this circuit.
