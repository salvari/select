Identify each type of JFET (whether it is N-channel or P-channel), label the terminals, and determine whether the JFET in each of these circuits will be turned {\it on} or {\it off}:

Follow-up question: explain why the lower-right circuit has question-marks next to the transistor.  Why is the JFET's state uncertain?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is very important for your students to understand what factor(s) in a circuit force a JFET to turn on or off.  Be sure to ask your students to explain their reasoning for each transistor's status.  What factor, or combination of factors, is necessary to turn a JFET on, versus off?  One point of this question is to emphasize the non-importance of $V_{DD}$'s polarity when there is an external biasing voltage applied directly between gate and source.
