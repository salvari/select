Suppose you needed to build a simple voltage regulator circuit with a regulation point of 4.5 volts, but had no zener diodes to work with.  Can you think of a way normal diodes could be used for the purpose instead?

(The number of series-connected diodes required depends on the actual forward voltage drop of each diode under loaded conditions.)

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may suggest to use normal diodes backwards, exploiting the reverse-breakdown phenomenon common to all PN junctions.  Whether or not this suggestion is made, ask your students why it would not be a practical solution in this case.
