Manipulate this equation algebraically, so that we can convert power gains expressed in units of Bels, into ratios.

$$A_{P(ratio)} = 10^{A_{P(Bels)}}$$

Then, convert the following power gains, expressed as ratios, into units of Bels:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 250 ; $A_P =$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 1275 ; $A_P =$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 10 ; $A_P =$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 1 ; $A_P =$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 0.1 ; $A_P =$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 0.025 ; $A_P =$
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 0.00009 ; $A_P =$

\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 1 ; $A_P =$ 0 B

\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 0.025 ; $A_P =$ -1.602 B

\item{$\bullet$} $A_P =$ 0.00009 ; $A_P =$ -4.046 B

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students to estimate the log values without using their calculators.  For example, they should be able to estimate the log of 1275 as being between 3 and 4; the log of 0.025 as being between -1 and -2.  Work together to devise a technique for doing this, where there will be no guessing.

Mathematical estimation is an important skill for technical people to possess.  Not only is it useful in the event no calculator is readily available, but it also helps greatly in students being able check their (electronically) calculated work.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen students blindly enter numbers into a calculator, only to arrive at an answer that is {\it grossly} in error, and not realize it at all because they cannot do the estimation mentally.
