$$\epsfbox{00999x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00999}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$y = 2x$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Your students should be able to recognize that this amplifier circuit has a voltage gain of 2, but expressing it in the form of an equation using variables such as $x$ and $y$ may be something very new to them.  Discuss with your students the significance of this notation: that a {\it circuit} may embody an {\it equation}.  Analog computers may be "obsolete" technology, but they still have many practical applications.
