Real inductors and capacitors are never purely reactive.  There will inevitably be some resistance intrinsic to these devices as well.

Suppose an inductor has 57 $\Omega$ of winding resistance, and 1500 $\Omega$ of reactance at a particular frequency.  How would this combination be expressed as a single impedance?  State your answer in both polar and rectangular forms.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

${\bf Z_L} =$ 1501 $\Omega$ $\angle$ 87.8$^{o}$ = 57 + j1500 $\Omega$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Mention to your students that "real" components such as this may be modeled in a diagram as a combination of two "pure" components, in this case a resistor and an inductor.  Discuss with them the benefits of "modeling" component characteristics in this manner, since it is a very common practice in engineering.

This is a very important concept to understand: that reactive components are never {\it purely} reactive.  Parasitic resistance is impossible to avoid short of using superconductors.  Even then, inductors are bound to have some parasitic capacitance, and capacitors are bound to have some parasitic inductance!
