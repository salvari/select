In an SOP expression, the minimum requirement for the expression's total value to be equal to 1 is that at least one of the product terms must be equal to 1.  For instance, in the following SOP expression, we know that the value will be equal to 1 if $ABC = 1$ or if $A\overline{B}\> \overline{C} = 1$ or if $AB\overline{C} = 1$:

$$ABC + A\overline{B}\> \overline{C} + AB\overline{C}$$

What is the minimum requirement for a POS expression to be equal to 0?  Take the following POS expression, for instance:

$$(A + B + C)(A + \overline{B} + C)(\overline{A} + B + C)$$

At the very least, what has to occur in order for this expression to equal 0?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

At least one of the sum terms must be equal to zero.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: in order for one of these terms to be equal to zero, thus making the whole expression equal to zero, what must be true about each of the Boolean literals (a {\it literal} is either a variable or the complement of a variable) within at least one of the sum terms?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question foreshadows the derivation of POS expressions from truth tables.  It also parallels the subject of polynomial roots in real-number algebra.  For instance, the polynomial $x^2 - 2x - 8$ may be factored as such:

$$(x - 4)(x + 2)$$

If we were to set this equation equal to zero, the {\it roots} of the equation would be 4 and -2: the values for $x$ which would make either one of the terms equal to zero.

You may find this mini-review of "normal" algebra to be helpful to your students, as they try to understand POS expressions.
