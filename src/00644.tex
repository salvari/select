Suppose you are building a circuit and you need an impedance of 1500 $\Omega$ $\angle$ -41$^{o}$ at a frequency of 600 Hz.  What combination of components could you connect together in series to achieve this precise impedance?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A 1132.1 $\Omega$ resistor connected in series with a 269.6 nF capacitor would suffice.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

As usual, the most important part of your students' answers is not the figures themselves, but rather their methods of solution.  Students should be very familiar with how to calculate the impedance of a series-connected group of components, but calculating component values from an impedance figure may be a challenge to some.
