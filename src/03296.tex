It is not uncommon to see impedances represented in AC circuits as boxes, rather than as combinations of R, L, and/or C.  This is simply a convenient way to represent what may be complex sub-networks of components in a larger AC circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03296x01.eps}$$

We know that any given impedance may be represented by a simple, two-component circuit: either a resistor and a reactive component connected in series, or a resistor and a reactive component connected in parallel.  Assuming a circuit frequency of 2 kHz, determine what combination of series-connected components will be equivalent to this "box" impedance, and also what combination of parallel-connected components will be equivalent to this "box" impedance.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Once students learn to convert between complex impedances, equivalent series R-X circuits, and equivalent parallel R-X circuits, it becomes possible for them to analyze the most complex series-parallel impedance combinations imaginable {\it without} having to do arithmetic with complex numbers (magnitudes and angles at every step).  It does, however, require that students have a good working knowledge of resistance, conductance, reactance, susceptance, impedance, and admittance, and how these quantities relate mathematically to one another in scalar form.
