Design a clipper circuit that eliminates the positive portion of this AC waveform, leaving only the negative half-cycles to appear on the output:

Note: the circuit shown here is not the only possible solution!

Follow-up question: the output waveform shown for this circuit is true only for an {\it ideal} diode, not a real diode.  Explain what the output waveform would look like if a real diode were used, and recommend a diode model that closely approximates the ideal case for this application.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A good review of basic diode concepts here.  Students should recognize the output waveform as being indicative of half-wave rectification, which may cause them to think of other circuit designs.
