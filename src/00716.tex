Engineers and scientists often use {\it energy band diagrams} to graphically illustrate the energy levels of electrons in different substances.  Electrons are shown as solid dots:

$$\epsfbox{00716x01.eps}$$

Based on these diagrams, answer the following questions:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Which type of material is the best conductor of electricity, and {\it why}?
\item{$\bullet$} Which type of material is the worst conductor of electricity, and {\it why}?
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} {\bf Metals} are the best conductors of electricity, because many of their electrons occupy the "conduction band" at normal temperatures.
\item{$\bullet$} {\bf Insulators} are the worst conductors of electricity, because a tremendous amount of energy must be invested before an electron can "leap" across the large gap into the conduction band.
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I have given more information in the answer to this question than usual for me, because this subject is rather complex.  One of the themes I'm trying to communicate in this question is that semiconductors are not just conductors with an unusually high amount of resistance.  The mechanism of conduction in a pure semiconductor is fundamentally different from that of a metal.

Though this can become confusing, electrical conduction in metallic substances actually has two different forms: one where two electron bands overlap (permitting electrons to drift into the upper band and move between atoms), and one where the highest "unexcited" electron band is only partially filled (permitting electrons to drift into the upper regions of that same band and move between atoms).  Whether or not this distinction is worthwhile to discuss in detail is a matter for you to decide.
