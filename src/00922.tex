An important parameter for many semiconductor components is {\it thermal resistance}, usually specified in units of degrees Celsius per Watt.  What does this rating mean, and how is it related to temperature?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Thermal resistance" is a measure of the heat differential required for a semiconductor component to dissipate a given amount of power.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss the nature of heat with your students: that a differential temperature ($\Delta T$) is required for transfer of heat through a medium such as a solid.  Compare this phenomenon with differences of electrical potential ($E$) and electric current ($I$).  How do we express an electrical conductor's ability to carry a moving charge under the influence of a potential difference?  

Ask your students what difference it makes whether a semiconductor component has a high or a low thermal resistance.  What is ideal for a semiconductor device, a high thermal resistance or a low thermal resistance?  Why?
