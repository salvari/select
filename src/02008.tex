Identify the voltages that are {\it supposed} to appear between the listed test points:

$$\epsfbox{02008x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{1.} $V_{TP1-TP2} =$
\item{2.} $V_{TP1-TP3} =$
\item{3.} $V_{TP2-TP3} =$
\item{4.} $V_{TP4-TP5} =$
\item{5.} $V_{TP5-TP6} =$
\item{6.} $V_{TP7-TP8} =$
\item{7.} $V_{TP9-TP10} =$
\medskip

Assume that the power transformer has a step-down ratio of 9.5:1.

\item{1.} $V_{TP1-TP2} =$ 120 volts AC
\item{2.} $V_{TP1-TP3} =$ 120 volts AC
\item{3.} $V_{TP2-TP3} =$ 0 volts
\item{4.} $V_{TP4-TP5} =$ 12.63 volts AC
\item{5.} $V_{TP5-TP6} =$ 12.63 volts AC
\item{6.} $V_{TP7-TP8} =$ 16.47 volts DC
\item{7.} $V_{TP9-TP10} =$ 16.47 volts DC

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Before one can troubleshoot a malfunctioning circuit, one must know what voltages and currents are {\it supposed} to be in various portions of the circuit.  This question, therefore, is a prelude to further troubleshooting questions.
