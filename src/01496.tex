The series resistances and parallel-connected diodes in this circuit act as a voltage {\it clipping} network.  Why do you suppose it would be important to limit, or "clip," the signal voltage before it reaches the rest of the circuitry?  The detector will function adequately without the diodes or resistors in place, so why are they there?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The clipping network protects your hearing in case of accidently connection to a large signal source.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Your students may not yet be familiar with the operation of semiconductor diodes.  For now, just explain that diodes only conduct current in one direction, and even then they do not begin to conduct until the voltage drop across them is approximately 0.7 volts (for silicon diodes).
