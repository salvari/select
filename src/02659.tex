%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $Q_6$ is an active load for $Q_4$
\item{$\bullet$} $Q_{23}$ is an active load for $Q_4$
\item{$\bullet$} $Q_{13}$ is an active load for $Q_{17}$ and $Q_{22}$
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Even if students do not yet know what an "operational amplifier" circuit is, they should still be able to identify transistor stages, configurations, and active loads.

%INDEX% Active load, used in BJT amplifier
%INDEX% Active loads, used in operational amplifier (internal) circuitry
