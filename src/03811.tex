What purpose(s) do the capacitors serve in this amplifier circuit?  Could we remove one or more of them and still have a working circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The capacitors block DC from being amplified at any stage, which may cause the amplifier(s) to saturate.  The last capacitor ($C_3$) prevents any possible DC from getting to the headphone.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The circuit design shown is a bit conservative.  That is, it should work well without {\it all} the capacitors shown.  However, experience has taught me a little over-building is good when it comes to increasing circuit reliability.
