Real filters never exhibit perfect "square-edge" Bode plot responses.  A typical low-pass filter circuit, for example, might have a frequency response that looks like this:

$$\epsfbox{01246x01.eps}$$

What does the term {\it rolloff} refer to, in the context of filter circuits and Bode plots?  Why would this parameter be important to a technician or engineer?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Rolloff" refers to the {\it slope} of the Bode plot in the attenuating range of the filter circuit, usually expressed in units of decibels per octave (dB/octave) or decibels per decade (dB/decade):

$$\epsfbox{01246x02.eps}$$

Point students' attention to the scale used on this particular Bode plot.  This is called a {\it log-log} scale, where neither vertical nor horizontal axis is linearly marked.  This scaling allows a very wide range of conditions to be shown on a relatively small plot, and is very common in filter circuit analysis.
