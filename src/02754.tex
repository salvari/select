%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students thinking in terms of "digital" quantities, which by their very nature are non-continuous.  It is important to note that the concepts of continuous and discrete quantities are not limited to electronics, but are found in a variety of places in every-day life.

It should be noted that some of these determinations are subjective.  The voltage output by a comparator may be considered discrete on a large time scale, but there is a measurable transition from "high" voltage to "low" voltage in which the output voltage is somewhere between full saturation limits.
