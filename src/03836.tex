Predict how the operation of this relay logic circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03836x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Pushbutton switch A fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay coil CR2 fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay contact CR1-1 fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay contact CR2-1 fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay contact CR2-2 fails shorted:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Pushbutton switch A fails open: {\it Lamp 1 always energized, lamp 2 simply becomes inverse status of pushbutton switch B.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay coil CR2 fails open: {\it Both lamp 1 and lamp 2 simply become inverse status of pushbutton switch A.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay contact CR1-1 fails open: {\it Lamp 1 simply becomes same status as pushbutton switch B.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay contact CR2-1 fails shorted: {\it Lamp 1 always energized.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Relay contact CR2-2 fails shorted: {\it Lamp 2 simply becomes inverse status of pushbutton switch A.}
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
