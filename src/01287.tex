Though many electronics students and professionals alike associate semiconductor components with the word "digital," electromechanical relays are also digital logic (on or off) devices.  In fact, some of the first digital computers were built with electromechanical relays as their active elements.

In what ways are electromechanical relays similar to semiconductor logic gates?  In what ways do the two digital technologies differ?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Like semiconductor gates, electromechanical relays have but two states: energized and de-energized (1 and 0).  Like gates, the contacts of relays may be interconnected to perform standard logic functions such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT.
