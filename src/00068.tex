%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One of the more difficult skills for students to develop is the ability to translate the layout of a real-world circuit into a neat schematic diagram.  Developing this skill requires lots of practice.

It is very worthwhile for students to discuss how they solve problems such as these with each other.  For those students who have trouble visualizing shapes, a simple hint or "trick" to use when translating schematics to illustrations or visa-versa may be invaluable.
