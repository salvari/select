Calculate the voltage gain for each stage of this amplifier circuit (both as a ratio and in units of decibels), then calculate the overall voltage gain:

Follow-up question: is this circuit inverting or noninverting, overall?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Not only does this question review calculation of voltage gain for inverting amplifier circuits, but it also reviews decibel calculations (for both single and multi-stage amplifiers).  Discuss how the decibel figures for each stage add to equal the total decibel gain, whereas the ratios multiply.
