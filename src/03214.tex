The following solid-state motor control circuit is called an {\it H-bridge}, and it uses four MOSFETs to switch polarity to a DC motor.  When the "Fwd" input line is driven to a logical "high" state, the motor spins in the forward direction.  Conversely, when the "Rvs" input line is driven "high," the motor spins in the opposite direction:

Complete this circuit with interlock logic, placing solid-state logic circuitry between the two pushbutton switches and the H-drive input terminals to prevent the motor from trying to go forward and reverse simultaneously.

This is perhaps the most straightforward solution, but by no means the only one:

$$\epsfbox{03214x02.eps}$$

Another possible solution would be to use an S-R latch when a low-low invalid state, with the $Q$ and $\overline{Q}$ outputs driving the two H-bridge input lines.  However, this would require a third switch in order to stop the motor.
