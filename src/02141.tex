When an SCR latches "on," it drops very little voltage between anode and cathode.  Explain why this is, and what advantage this gives SCRs over transistors when conducting heavy load currents.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The constituent transistors of an SCR become driven heavily into saturation in its conductive state, with a bare minimum of drive (gate) current necessary.

Follow-up question: how does the internal operation of an SCR explain its very fast turn-on time, in addition to explaining its low conducting voltage drop?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The key to fully answering why an SCR drives itself so hard during conduction is found in the principle of {\it positive feedback}.  Discuss this principle with your students if they have not already studied it.  If they have already studied it, use this question as an opportunity for review.
