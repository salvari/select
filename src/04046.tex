Calculate the amount of voltage between points {\bf A} and {\bf B} in this circuit.  Be sure to identify polarity as well as magnitude:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{\bf AB}$ = 6.148 volts, {\bf A} negative and {\bf B} positive.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing here but series-parallel calculation practice, combined with KVL.  Ask your students to explain {\it how} they calculated this voltage, because there is definitely more than one way to do it!
