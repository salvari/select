Suppose a few turns of wire within the inductor in this filter circuit suddenly became short-circuited, so that the inductor effectively has fewer turns of wire than it did before:

$$\epsfbox{03505x01.eps}$$

What sort of effect would this fault have on the filtering action of this circuit?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The resonant frequency of the circuit would {\it increase}.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what would happen to the $Q$ of this filter circuit as a result of the fault within the inductor?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Determining the effect on resonant frequency is a simple matter of qualitative analysis with the resonant frequency formula.  The effect on Q (challenge question) may be answered just as easily if the students know the formula relating bandwidth to $L$, $C$, and $R$.
