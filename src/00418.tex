%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "balanced" polyphase system is one where all line voltages are equal to each other, and all line currents are also equal to each other.  "Unbalanced" conditions usually stem from unsymmetrical loads, although severe imbalances may be caused by faults in the system.

Ask your students which type of three-phase system (balanced or unbalanced) is easier to analyze, and why that is so.
