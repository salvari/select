%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this exercise is for students to connect a multiplexer to fulfill an arbitrary logic function specified by the instructor, thus showing the flexibility of the technique.

Here, the arrangement of the input letters C, B, and A is purposeful: C represents the most significant bit, while A represents the least significant bit, just like the IC datasheets typically order the input lines.
