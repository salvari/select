Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts.  Specify standard resistor values, all between 1 k$\Omega$ and 100 k$\Omega$ (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).  Use a sine-wave function generator to supply an audio-frequency input signal, and make sure its amplitude isn't set so high that the amplifier clips.

I have had good success using the following values:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{CC}$ = 6 volts
\item{$\bullet$} $V_{in}$ = 1 volt (peak)
\item{$\bullet$} $R_1$ = $R_2$ = 10 k$\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} $R_3$ = $R_4$ = 10 $\Omega$
\item{$\bullet$} $C_1$ = 0.47 $\mu$F
\item{$\bullet$} $C_2$ = 10 $\mu$F
\item{$\bullet$} $C_3$ = 47 $\mu$F
\item{$\bullet$} $D_1$ = $D_2$ = part number 1N4001
\item{$\bullet$} $Q_1$ = part number 2N2222
\item{$\bullet$} $Q_2$ = part number 2N2907

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
