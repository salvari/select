Electric motors of the {\it permanent magnet} design are very simple to reverse: just switch the polarity of the DC power to the motor, and it will spin the other direction:

Complete this schematic diagram, showing how a DPDT switch may be placed in this circuit to reverse the motor's direction of rotation without the need to disconnect and re-connect wires:
