The following ladder logic diagram (for a steam heater control) contains a serious mistake:

$$\epsfbox{01350x01.eps}$$

This is a mistake I've seen many students make.  Explain what the mistake is, and draw a corrected version of this relay circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Never, ever connect load devices in series in a control circuit such as this!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why load devices are never to be connected in series.  What would be the effect of doing so?  Have them answer this question in terms of normal operation, and also in terms of operation given a failure condition in one of the series-connected load devices.
