%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Don't give your students the equation with which to perform this calculation!  Let them find it on their own.  The ${di \over dt}$ notation may be foreign to students lacking a strong mathematical background, but don't let this be an obstacle to learning!  Rather, use this as a way to introduce those students to the concept of {\it rates of change}, and to the calculus concept of the {\it derivative}.
