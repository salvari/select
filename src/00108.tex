{\it Voltage} is commonly defined as "electrical pressure."  The unit of the {\it volt}, however, may be defined in terms of more fundamental physical units.  What are these units, and how do they relate to the unit of the volt?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

1 volt is equal to 1 joule of energy imparted to 1 coulomb of charge ($6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons):

$$V = {W \over Q}$$

\noindent
Where,

$V =$ Voltage (volts)

$W =$ Work, or potential energy (joules)

$Q =$ Charge (coulombs)

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Note that I use the letter "V" to denote voltage rather than "E" as I usually do.  This is because in general physics work, "E" usually stands for either "Energy" or "Electric field".  Some electronics reference books use the letter "E" for voltage, while others use the letter "V", or even use the two letters interchangeably.
