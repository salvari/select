Although field-effect transistors are not usually characterized in terms of current gain as bipolar junction transistors are, it would not be wrong to speak of FETs as having current gains.  Compared to a BJT, how does the current gain of a FET compare?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Field-effect transistors have {\it enormous} current gains compared to bipolar junction transistors, due to their extremely high input impedances.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain why a FET (JFET or MOSFET) has such a large current gain compared to a typical BJT.  What is it about the function of a field-effect transistor that makes it such a powerful current-amplifying device?
