I'll let you research the definitions to these terms!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The words "accuracy" and "precision" are often (incorrectly) interchanged with one another.  They have distinct and separate meanings, though.

Regarding the word "traceability," you might want to elaborate on electrical metrology as a career in itself.  Maintaining international measurement standards is a work-intensive endeavor, and qualified electronics people at all levels of expertise (technicians, engineers, researchers, scientists) are needed in many locations around the world to maintain the system.  Though it may sound boring, metrology is essential to state-of-the art scientific research as well as modern industry.
