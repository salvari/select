Suppose this 10-mile-long RG-58/U cable were "terminated" by a resistor with a resistance equal to the cable's own characteristic impedance:

$$\epsfbox{00132x01.eps}$$

What sort of waveform or pulse would the oscilloscope register after switch closure?

\underbar{file 00132}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The oscilloscope would register a continuous current of 480 mA any time the switch is closed.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to compare the behavior of this circuit with that of an unterminated RG-58/U cable.  How does this circuit's behavior differ?  Why is that?

To phrase the question in a different way, what does the inclusion of a terminating resistor do to the apparent {\it length} of the cable?  In other words, what length of RG-58/U cable would behave exactly the same as this circuit?
