This schematic diagram shows a 555 timer configured for astable (oscillator) operation.  The components drawn in grey are internal to the 555 IC, while the components drawn in black are discrete:

$$\epsfbox{03031x01.eps}$$

Identify the following parameters for this circuit while the capacitor is {\it charging}:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Complete path of charging current (note whether you draw according to conventional or electron flow)
\item{$\bullet$} Status of bipolar transistor inside the 555 timer IC (on or off)
\item{$\bullet$} Logic state of S-R latch $Q$ output inside the 555 timer IC
\item{$\bullet$} Logic state of S-R latch $\overline{Q}$ output inside the 555 timer IC
\medskip
