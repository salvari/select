Write an SOP expression for this truth table, and then draw a gate circuit diagram corresponding to that SOP expression:

% Graphic image replaced by TeX table, April 5, 2005
%$$\epsfbox{01333x01.eps}$$

% No blank lines allowed between lines of an \halign structure!
% I use comments (%) instead, so that TeX doesn't choke.

Finally, simplify this expression using Boolean algebra, and draw a simplified gate circuit based on this new (reduced) Boolean expression.

\vskip 10pt

Reduced expression and gate circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01333x03.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the utility of Boolean algebra as a circuit simplification tool.  Ask your students to compare the original and reduced logic gate circuits, and comment on such performance metrics as reliability, power consumption, maximum operating speed, etc.
