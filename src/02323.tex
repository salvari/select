The typical amount of current through a MOSFET gate terminal is far less than the typical amount of current through a BJT base terminal, for similar controlled currents (drain or collector, respectively).  Explain what it is about the construction and/or use of the MOSFET that limits the input current to almost nothing during normal operation.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The gate is electrically insulated from the channel.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If need be, refer back to a "cut-away" diagram of a MOSFET to help your students understand why the input impedance of a MOSFET is what it is.
