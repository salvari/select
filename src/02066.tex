The equivalent circuit for an IGBT -- comprised of a MOSFET coupled to a BJT -- bears resemblance to a couple of other BJT circuits you may have seen before:

$$\epsfbox{02066x01.eps}$$

Which of these two paired-BJT circuits most resembles the IGBT equivalent circuit, in terms of what two terminals the control signal voltage must be applied between to turn the device on?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The Sziklai pair most resembles the IGBT equivalent circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is important for students to realize what two terminals of the device the input (control) signal must be applied to in order to turn the device on.  This is really the point of the question, not so much a review of Darlington versus Sziklai pairs.
