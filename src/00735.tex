If a closed-circuit wire coil is brought closer to the end of a permanent magnet, a repulsive force will develop between the magnet and the coil.  This force will cease, however, when the coil stops moving.  What is this effect called?

Also, describe what will happen if the wire coil fails open.  Does the same effect persist?  Why or why not?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The phenomenon is known as {\it Lenz' Law}, and it exists only when there is a continuous path for current (i.e. a complete circuit) in the wire coil.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The phenomenon of Lenz's Law is usually showcased using a metal solid such as a disk or ring, rather than a wire coil, but the phenomenon is the same.
