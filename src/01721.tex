Suppose I connect two resistors in series with one another, like this:

$$\epsfbox{01721x01.eps}$$

How much electrical resistance would you expect an ohmmeter to indicate if it were connected across the combination of these two series-connected resistors?

$$\epsfbox{01721x02.eps}$$

Explain the reasoning behind your answer, and try to formulate a generalization for all combinations of series resistances.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01721x03.eps}$$

Follow-up question: how much resistance would you expect the ohmmeter to register if there were {\it three} similarly-sized resistors connected in series instead of two?  What if there were {\it four} resistors?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The concept of series (total) resistance, in relation to individual resistances, usually does not present any difficulties to new students.  Parallel resistances are a bit trickier, though . . .
