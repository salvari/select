When a pulse propagates down a cable terminated by a short-circuit, what does it do?  Does it simply vanish, or does it go some place else?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A voltage pulse, upon reaching the shorted end of a cable, will be "reflected" back in the direction from which it came, its polarity being reversed while the current moves in the same direction.

$$\epsfbox{00134x01.eps}$$

After the reflected pulse reaches the source, there will be minimum voltage at the source terminals and maximum current in the cable.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

To help answer this question, it is helpful to ask students how voltage and current relate to each other in a short-circuit condition (minimum voltage, maximum current).
