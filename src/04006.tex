Suppose we were designing a pair of BJT amplifier circuits to connect to either end of a long two-conductor cable, each end coupled to its respective amplifier through a transformer:

$$\epsfbox{04006x01.eps}$$

How would we choose the component values in each transistor amplifier circuit to naturally terminate both ends of the 75 $\Omega$ cable?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_C$ of the transmitting amplifier should be 1.875 k$\Omega$, as should the parallel equivalent resistance $R_{B1} || R_{B2}$ of the receiving amplifier.

This question is really a review of Th\'evenin's theorem as it applies to common-emitter, divider-biased BJT amplifier circuits, and also impedance transformation as it applies to step-up and step-down transformers. 

In case anyone asks, the "zig-zags" in the four lines for the cable represent an unspecified distance between those points.  In other words, the cable is {\it longer} than what may be proportionately represented on the schematic diagram.
