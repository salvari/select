Determine the approximate amount of collector current for this transistor circuit, given the following characteristic curve set for the transistor:

$$\epsfbox{02435x02.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02435x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02435}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_C \approx$ 4.75 mA

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: how much will the collector current rise if the voltage source increases to 35 volts?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is nothing more than an exercise in interpreting characteristic curves.
