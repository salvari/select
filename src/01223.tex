In digital computer systems, binary numbers are often represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 8, or 16, or 32.  Such bit groupings are often given special names, because they are so common in digital systems:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} byte
\item{$\bullet$} nybble
\item{$\bullet$} word
\medskip

How many binary bits is represented by each of the above terms?

\vskip 10pt

And, for those looking for more challenge, try defining these terms:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} nickle
\item{$\bullet$} deckle
\item{$\bullet$} chawmp
\item{$\bullet$} playte
\item{$\bullet$} dynner
\medskip

\underbar{file 01223}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} byte = 8 bits
\item{$\bullet$} nybble = 4 bits
\item{$\bullet$} word = {\it depends on the system}
\medskip

The term "word," is often used to represent 16 bits, but it really depends on the particular system being spoken of.  A binary "word" is more accurately defined as the default width of a binary bit grouping in a digital system.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what binary grouping corresponds to a single hexadecimal character?
