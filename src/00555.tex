All electrical soldering, and most other forms of soldering as well, requires the addition of a substance known as {\it flux}.  What is the purpose of adding "flux" to the soldering process, and what type of flux is typically used for electrical soldering?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Flux" is a substance that chemically cleans the metal surfaces prior to soldering.  For electrical work, the preferred flux is "rosin".

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question, and the corresponding answer, point to one of the fundamental requirements for a good solder joint: clean metal surfaces.  Flux is designed to chemically clean the joint prior to and during the soldering process, but it is no substitute for proper preparatory cleaning beforehand.

Discuss this point with your students.  If possible, set up some wire connections to be soldered, and show the effects of a small amount of oil or grease on a solder joint (even when using flux).
