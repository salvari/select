An obsolete display technology that still finds enthusiastic followers in the hobbyist world, called {\it Nixie tubes}, relies on a BCD-to-10 decoder to drive one of ten different metal cathodes inside a neon-filled glass bulb.  For each BCD code, exactly one of the cathode figures inside the "Nixie tube" will glow, causing that numeral to shine with a pink-orange light.  The tube receives power through a common anode (usually over 150 volts DC).

A friend of yours is trying to build his own Nixie tube display circuit, but is experiencing problems.  He wants to use a 7442 BCD-to-10 decoder to drive ten discrete transistors, each one handling the current for a digit in the tube.  Being cautious, your friend decides to connect just one of the Nixie tube digits to a transistor, and then to the 7442, to see if the idea works (before connecting all ten).

Unfortunately, that one digit begins to glow the moment the high-voltage DC supply is turned on, even before the 7442 chip receives power!  And after that, the 7442 gets warm to the touch, which is not good.

Thinking he has damaged the 7442 IC, your friend turns to you for advice.  Did he do anything wrong here?  Explain what advice you would give to him.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The transistor is not correct.  Your friend will have to have a different transistor output stage for his display circuit!

Follow-up question: comment on your friends' strategy to connect only one transistor to one Nixie tube cathode for a test.  Was this a good idea?  Why or why not?  Did doing this save the 7442 from further damage?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I have left the answer purposefully vague so that students will have to figure out how to properly use BJTs to drive the Nixie tube cathodes.  This is a good opportunity for them to review BJT theory and switch application use, so don't spoil it by giving away the answer!
