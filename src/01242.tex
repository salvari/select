Describe what happens to each of the output voltages ($V_{out1}$ and $V_{out2}$) as the input voltage ($V_{in}$) {\it decreases}:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{out1}$ will decrease (become more negative), while $V_{out2}$ will increase (become more positive).

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

With four terminals to connect to the outside world, this circuit is a {\it differential-input}, {\it differential-output} amplifier.
