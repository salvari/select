When counters are used as frequency dividers, they are often drawn as simple boxes with one input and one output each, like this:

$$\epsfbox{03073x01.eps}$$

Calculate the four output frequencies ($f_{out1}$ through $f_{out4}$) given an input frequency of 25 kHz:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out1}$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out2}$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out3}$ = 
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out4}$ = 
\medskip

\underbar{file 03073}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out1}$ = 5 kHz
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out2}$ = 625 Hz
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out3}$ = 312.5 Hz
\item{$\bullet$} $f_{out4}$ = 31.25 Hz
\medskip

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: if the clock frequency for this divider circuit is {\it exactly} 25 kHz, is it possible for the divided frequencies to vary from what is predicted by the modulus values (5 kHz, 625 Hz, 312.5 Hz, and 31.25 Hz)?  Explain why or why not.

The purpose of this question is to introduce students to the schematic convention of counter/dividers as simple boxes with "MOD" specified for each one, and to provide a bit of quantitative analysis (albeit very simple).
