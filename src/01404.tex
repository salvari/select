%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Four bit counter modulus = 16.

\vskip 10pt

Eight bit counter modulus = 256.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: is it possible for a four-bit counter to have a modulus equal to some value other than 16?  Give an example!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The real purpose of this question is to get students to find out what term "modulus" means, and how it relates to counter bits.
