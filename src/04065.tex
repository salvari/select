Calculate the total (source) current in this parallel RC circuit, based on the readings taken by the dual-trace oscilloscope (both of the inductive current probes show branch currents in units of 1 amp per division):

$$\epsfbox{04065x01.eps}$$

$I_{total}$ =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{total}$ = 3.61 amps peak or 2.55 amps RMS

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a really simple trigonometry problem, disguised by the necessity of having to interpret the oscilloscope display.
