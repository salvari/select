This device is known as a {\it switch}, and its purpose in this circuit is to establish or interrupt the electrical continuity of the circuit in order to control the light bulb.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Beginning students often find the terminology for switches confusing, because the words {\it open} and {\it closed} sound similar to the terminology used for doors, but do not mean quite the same thing when used in reference to a switch!  In order to help avoid confusion, ask the students how they may think of these terms in a way that is consistent with their meaning in the context of an electrical switch.

One analogy to use for the switch's function that makes sense with the schematic is a drawbridge: when the bridge is down (closed), cars may cross; when the bridge is up (open), cars cannot.
