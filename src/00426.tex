Several conversions are necessary to calculate the answer for this question.  As usual, the purpose of this question is not so much to obtain an answer, as it is to develop students' problem-solving skills.  How did students approach this problem?  Did any of them think of ways to simplify the problem so that it could be solved in incremental steps instead of all at once?  If so, what was their method(s) of solution?
