Draw a schematic diagram showing how the windings (coils) of a {\it Delta} three-phase AC generator are connected together:

\vskip 100pt

Then, calculate the line current if the phase current in this generator is 20 amps.  Assume this generator operates in a balanced condition (all phase voltages and currents equal).
