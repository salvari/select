%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I$ = 2.273 mA

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question, besides giving students reason to review a current-to-voltage converter opamp circuit, is to preview the behavior of an active differentiator using the same resistor and output voltage values (question \#02698).
