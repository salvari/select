Determine (qualitatively) what will happen to the following parameters in this circuit as {\it frequency} is decreased (assume $V_{supply}$ remains constant):

$$\epsfbox{03606x01.eps}$$

$I_{total}$ = {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}?

\vskip 10pt

$V_{R1}$ = {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}? 

\vskip 10pt

$I_{C1}$ = {\it increase}, {\it decrease}, or {\it stay the same}? 

\vskip 10pt

Phase shift ($\Theta$) between $V_{total}$ and $I_{total}$ = {\it increase} (approach -90$^{o}$), {\it decrease} (approach 0$^{o}$), or {\it stay the same}?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{total}$ = {\it decrease}

\vskip 10pt

$V_{R1}$ = {\it stay the same} 

\vskip 10pt

$I_{C1}$ = {\it decrease}

\vskip 10pt

Phase shift ($\Theta$) between $V_{total}$ and $I_{total}$ = {\it decrease} (approach 0$^{o}$)
