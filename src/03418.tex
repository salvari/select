You are hired to work on a design team, building an electric car.  One of the electrical engineers has calculated that a battery pack with a capacity of 100 amp-hours should give the car at least a 200 mile range at 70 miles per hour, assuming an average motor power output of 18 horsepower at that speed.  Given that the nominal battery pack voltage is 420 volts, calculate the actual range of the car in miles at the assumed cruising speed of 70 miles per hour.  Use 746 watts per horsepower for your power conversion factor, and use the simple amp-hour formula where capacity equals amps times hours ($K = It$).
