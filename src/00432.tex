If we were to "model" a neon lamp with a standard passive component (resistor, voltage source, current source, capacitor, or inductor) for the sake of mathematically analyzing a circuit containing a neon lamp, what component would best represent the characteristics of the lamp within its "glow" region?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A neon lamp within its "glow" region would be best modeled by a {\it voltage source}.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what component best models a neon lamp within the vertical (dashed-line) regions on the graph?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If your students are perplexed at the method of determining the answer, ask them this question: "For the neon lamp, what variable remains {\it constant} despite a wide variation in the other variable?"
