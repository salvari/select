Explain what {\it slip speed} is for an AC induction motor, and why there must be such as thing as "slip" in order for an induction motor to generate torque.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The difference between the speed of the rotating magnetic field (fixed by line power frequency) and the speed of the rotor is called "slip speed".  Some amount of slip is necessary to generate torque because without it there would be no change in magnetic flux ($d\phi \over dt$) seen by the rotor, and thus no induced currents in the rotor.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is easy enough for students to research "slip speed" in any motor reference book and present a definition.  It is quite another for them to explain {\it why} slip is necessary.  Be sure to allow ample time in class to discuss this concept, because it is at the heart of induction motor operation.
