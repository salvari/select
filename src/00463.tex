Write the equation describing the voltage induced in this coil, solving for (instantaneous) induced voltage ($e$) in terms of the instantaneous magnetic flux ($\phi$) and the number of turns of wire in the coil:

$$\epsfbox{00463x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00463}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$e = N{d\phi \over dt}$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for the number of turns ($N$) given all the other quantities.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It should be noted that in this particular case, $N$ is equal to three (counting the turns in the illustrated coil).
