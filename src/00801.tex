In this circuit, an op-amp turns on an LED if the proper input voltage conditions are met:

$$\epsfbox{00801x01.eps}$$

Trace the complete path of current powering the LED.  Where, exactly, does the LED get its power from?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The arrows shown in this diagram trace "conventional" current flow, not electron flow:

$$\epsfbox{00801x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The important thing to note here is that the load current does not pass through either of the op-amp's input terminals.  All load current is sourced by the op-amp's power supply!  Discuss the importance of this fact with your students.
