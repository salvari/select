If a capacitor and an inductor are connected in series, and energized by an AC voltage source with such a frequency that the reactances of each component are 125 $\Omega$ and 170 $\Omega$, respectively, what is the total impedance of the series combination?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

45 $\Omega$ $\angle$ 90$^{o}$

Now, of course, you are wondering: "how can two series-connected components have a total impedance that is {\it less} than either of their individual impedances?"  Don't series impedances add to equal the total impedance, just like series resistances?  Be prepared to explain what is happening in this circuit, during discussion time with your classmates.

This question is an exercise in complex number arithmetic, and it is quite counter-intuitive at first.  Discuss this problem in depth with your students, so that they are sure to comprehend the phenomenon of series-canceling impedances.
