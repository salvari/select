What would happen to the voltage across capacitor $C_2$ if the following steps were followed, over and over again:

$$\epsfbox{01456x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Connect capacitor $C_1$ to battery, allow to fully charge
\item{$\bullet$} Disconnect capacitor $C_1$ from battery
\item{$\bullet$} Connect capacitor $C_1$ to capacitor $C_2$, allow for charges to equalize
\item{$\bullet$} Disconnect capacitor $C_1$ from capacitor $C_2$
\item{$\bullet$} Repeat
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Eventually, the voltage across capacitor $C_2$ would be equal to the battery voltage.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: how do the relative sizes of the capacitors (in Farads) affect this process?  For example, what if $C_1$ = 10 $\mu$F and $C_2$ = 470 $\mu$F?  Or, what if $C_1$ = 330 $\mu$F and $C_2$ = 2.2 $\mu$F?  Explain your answer.
