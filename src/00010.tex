%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

There are $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons in one {\it coulomb} of charge.  What would this appear as without the use of scientific notation?  Write this same figure using the most appropriate metric prefix.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A little math review here: using scientific notation to denote very large (or very small) numbers.

%INDEX% Electrons
%INDEX% Coulomb, defined
%INDEX% Charge, defined
