A technician decides to use a potentiometer as a speed control for an electric motor.  The potentiometer has a resistance rating of 10 $\Omega$ and a power rating of 25 watts:

$$\epsfbox{00340x01.eps}$$

When operating the motor at a voltage of 16 volts and a current of 2 amps, though, smoke begins to pour out of the potentiometer, indicating that its power rating is being exceeded.

The technician is perplexed!  According to his calculations, the potentiometer should be dissipating less than 25 watts of power.  Why, then, is a potentiometer rated for 25 watts burning up under this condition?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The power rating of a potentiometer is based on the heat dispersing ability of the {\it entire} resistive element.  The actual power dissipation rating of a potentiometer must be "de-rated" for wiper positions not utilizing the whole length of the resistive element.

Challenge question: based on the voltage and current values measured in this circuit (16 volts across the motor, 24 volts from the source, and 2 amps of current through it all), determine how badly the potentiometer is being overpowered.  In other words, calculate the de-rated power rating of the potentiometer and compare that against the amount of power it is actually dissipating in this condition.

A very practical and important lesson, learned after watching students send many potentiometers to an early demise.

In order to answer the challenge question, students must determine the pot's setting as a percentage between 0\% (0 $\Omega$) and 100\% (10 $\Omega$), and use that setting to estimate power de-rating.  It is safe to assume a linear power derating proportional to wiper position.
