%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify schematic diagram.  Your real circuit will verify the pictorial diagram.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use regulated power supplies with adjustable current limits to act as current sources (voltage adjustments set to "full" while current adjustments set the desired output current for each).  Keep the currents less than one amp for each supply.

%INDEX% Assessment, performance-based (Connecting 3 DC sources to achieve desired total current)
