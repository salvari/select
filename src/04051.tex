Complete a timing diagram for this circuit, and determine its direction of count, and also whether it is a {\it synchronous} counter or an {\it asynchronous} counter:

$$\epsfbox{04051x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{04051x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 04051}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an {\it asynchronous} "up" counter.

$$\epsfbox{04051x03.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

"Walk" through the timing diagram given in the answer, and have students explain how the logic states correspond to a two-bit binary counting sequence.

%INDEX% Counter, asynchronous
