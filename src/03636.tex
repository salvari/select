A student builds an audio tone-control circuit, for adjusting the amount of bass and treble heard at the headphone (note that this is a single-channel, or {\it mono}, circuit rather than stereo):

$$\epsfbox{03636x01.eps}$$

After successfully building and using this circuit for some time, the student finds that the bass control seems to have stopped working.  Turning the "bass" potentiometer knob back and forth does absolutely nothing to change the tone or volume of the sound heard at the headphones.  Identify the following:

\vskip 10pt

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} \underbar{One} failed component in the circuit that could possibly account for the problem, and the type of fault (open or short) you suspect that component would have.
\vskip 40pt
\item{$\bullet$} Identify the type of test measurement you would take on this circuit, and where you would take it, to begin isolating the exact point of failure.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\noindent
{\bf Possible component faults}

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Inductor $L_1$ failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Bass potentiometer failed either open or shorted
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Wire(s) between any of the above components failed open
\medskip

One could take either voltage, current, or resistance measurements along the top side of the circuit.  Resistance measurement would probably be the most informative type of measurement to take.
