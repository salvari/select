%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question simply asks students to interpret potentiometer action in the context of a negative-feedback opamp circuit.  Many students seem to experience confusion on the subject of three-terminal potentiometer operation (when {\it not} used as a rheostat), so be sure to spend adequate time discussing this with them.
