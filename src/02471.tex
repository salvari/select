%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Not only does this question review calculation of voltage gain for inverting amplifier circuits, but it also reviews decibel calculations (for both single and multi-stage amplifiers).  Discuss how the decibel figures for each stage add to equal the total decibel gain, whereas the ratios multiply.
