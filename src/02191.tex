An AC load exhibits a lagging power factor of 0.73 at 230 VAC and 315 amps.  If the system frequency is 60 Hz, calculate the following:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Apparent power ($S$) =
\item{$\bullet$} True power ($P$) =
\item{$\bullet$} Reactive power ($Q$) =
\item{$\bullet$} $\Theta$ =
\item{$\bullet$} Necessary parallel $C$ size to correct power factor to unity =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Apparent power ($S$) = 72.45 kVA
\item{$\bullet$} True power ($P$) = 52.89 kW
\item{$\bullet$} Reactive power ($Q$) = 49.52 kVAR
\item{$\bullet$} $\Theta$ = 43.11$^{o}$
\item{$\bullet$} Necessary parallel $C$ size to correct power factor to unity = 2,483 $\mu$F
