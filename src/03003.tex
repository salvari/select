Explain how the following decimal-to-BCD encoder circuit works:

$$\epsfbox{03003x01.eps}$$

Also, determine which output ($D$ or $A$) is the {\it most significant bit} of the BCD output.

\underbar{file 03003}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you figure out the details of how this circuit functions, but I will tell you that $D$ is the MSB.

Follow-up question: what would have to be modified in order to turn this into a hexadecimal-to-binary (16 line to 4 line) encoder?  Would any additional OR gates have to be added to the circuit?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Non-priority encoder circuits such as this one are fairly simple to figure out, and so I do not provide an explanation for students in the "Answer" section.
