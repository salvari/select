In a typical step-up or step-down transformer, the higher-voltage winding usually uses finer gauge wire than the lower-voltage winding.  Explain why this is.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The higher-voltage winding handles less current than the lower-voltage winding.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If you happen to have a transformer that has been cut in half (right through the core), it will make an excellent demonstration piece for discussion.  The difference between windings will be immediately apparent to the students when they see one.
