How much water {\it must} flow out of the pipe with the question-mark symbols next to it?

$$\epsfbox{00350x01.eps}$$

Explain how this hydraulic example relates to Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) in an electric circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

550 gallons per minute ("GPM"), assuming no leaks in the pipe.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to draw an electric circuit schematic showing how the same principle illustrated in the hydraulic system would apply to electric current, with "flow rates" of 700 amps, 150 amps, and 550 amps, respectively.
