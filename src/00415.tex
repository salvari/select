What would we have to do in order to reverse the rotation of this three-phase induction motor?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Reverse any two lines.  This will reverse the phase sequence (from ABC to CBA).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

One of the reasons three-phase motors are preferred in industry is the simplicity of rotation reversal.  However, this is also a problem because when you connect a three-phase motor to its power source during maintenance or installation procedures, you often do not know which way it will rotate until you turn the power on!

Discuss with your students how an electrician might go about his or her job when installing a three-phase motor.  What would be the proper lock-out/tag-out sequence, and steps to take when connecting a motor to its power source?  What would have to be done if it is found the motor rotates in the wrong direction?
