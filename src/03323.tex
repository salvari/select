Solve for the value of $x$ in the following equations:

$$5x = 15 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = $$

\vskip 10pt

$$6 = {x \over 2} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = $$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$5x = 15 \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 3$$

$$6 = {x \over 2} \hbox{\hskip 30pt} x = 12$$

Have your students come to the front of the class and show everyone else the techniques they used to solve for the value of $x$ in each equation.  Remind them to document each and every step in the process, so that nothing is left to guess or to chance.
