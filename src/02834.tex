A {\it Karnaugh map} is nothing more than a special form of truth table, useful for reducing logic functions into minimal Boolean expressions.

Here is a truth table for a specific three-input logic circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02834x01.eps}$$

Complete the following Karnaugh map, according to the values found in the above truth table:

$$\epsfbox{02834x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02834}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02834x03.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Showing students that Karnaugh maps are really nothing more than truth tables in disguise helps them to more readily learn this powerful new tool.
