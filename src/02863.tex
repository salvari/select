For a true TTL gate (not high-speed CMOS), what is the default logic state of an input line that is left floating (neither connected to $V_{CC}$ nor Ground)?  Explain why this is.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Floating TTL inputs generally assume a "high" state due to the steering diode/resistor network on the input stage of each gate circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The given answer does not provide enough detail to explain {\it why} TTL inputs tend to float high, so I recommend you display an internal TTL gate schematic for your students to analyze and comment on in class.

%INDEX% Floating input, TTL
