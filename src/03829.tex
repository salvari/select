Identify at least three independent faults that could cause this motor not to start:

$$\epsfbox{03829x01.eps}$$

For each of the proposed faults, explain {\it why} they would prevent the motor from starting.

\underbar{file 03829}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here are some possible faults (not an exhaustive list by any means!):

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Any fuse blown
\item{$\bullet$} Contactor coil failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Any transformer winding failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Broken jumper between H3 and H2 on the transformer
\item{$\bullet$} Corroded wire connection at terminal A1 or A2
\item{$\bullet$} Motor winding failed shorted
\medskip

Follow-up question: there will be a difference in operation between the L1 fuse blowing and either the L2 or L3 fuse blowing.  Explain what this difference is, and why it might serve as a clue to what was wrong.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Identifying multiple faults should be quite easy in this circuit.  The real value of this question is the opportunity for explanation and discussion that it generates for your students as they share their answers with each other.
