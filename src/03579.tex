Calculate total impedance ($Z_{total}$), total current ($I_{total}$), resistor current ($I_R$), and inductor current ($I_L$) in the following circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03579x01.eps}$$

$Z_{total}$ =

\vskip 10pt

$I_{total}$ = 

\vskip 10pt

$I_{L}$ = 

\vskip 10pt

$I_{R}$ =

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$Z_{total}$ = 2.784 k$\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$I_{total}$ = 1.078 mA

\vskip 10pt

$I_{L}$ = 868.1 $\mu$A

\vskip 10pt

$I_{R}$ = 638.3 $\mu$A
