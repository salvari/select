Explain why carefully matched resistors and transistors are necessary in log/antilog circuits, using your own words.  Also, explain why the operational amplifiers themselves need not be matched as precisely as the discrete components.

I said, "your own words," not mine!  What are you looking here for?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question challenges students to identify the "weak points" of log/antilog circuits, explaining {\it why} certain component tolerances are critical and others are not.  This is a good test of students' understanding regarding log/antilog circuits and their underlying theory.
