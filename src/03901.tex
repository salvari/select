A student builds a four-bit asynchronous {\it up} counter out of individual J-K flip-flops, but is dissatisfied with its performance:

$$\epsfbox{03901x01.eps}$$

Although the counting sequence is proper, the circuit usually does not begin counting from {\tt 0000} at power-up.  The fact that the circuit counts correctly suggests that there is nothing failed or mis-wired, so what could possibly be wrong?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The flip-flops' initial states at power-up are essentially random because they are subject to internal {\it race conditions} between the constituent gates.  What is needed is some form of {\it automatic reset} to force all flip-flops to the reset state at power-up.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very practical issue for state-machine circuits: making sure the circuit begins in the desired state rather than in some random condition.
