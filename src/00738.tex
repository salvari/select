Explain what will happen to the magnetized rotor when 3-phase AC power is applied to the stationary electromagnet coils:

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The magnetic rotor will rotate as it tries to orient itself with the rotating magnetic field.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what must we do with the AC power energizing the coils to increase the rotor's rotational speed?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, we see a practical 3-phase electric motor.  Be sure to thoroughly discuss what is necessary to increase or decrease rotor speed, and compare this with what is necessary to increase or decrease speed in a DC motor.
