Calculate the amount of phase shift between voltage and current in an AC circuit with a power factor of 0.97 (lagging), and an apparent power of 3.5 kVA.  Also, write the equation solving for phase shift, in degrees.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$\Theta = \arccos (PF)$ = 14.1$^{o}$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students whether this circuit is predominantly capacitive or predominantly inductive, and also how they know it is such.

It is very important for students to be able to solve for angles in simple trigonometric equations, using "arcfunctions," so be sure you discuss the method of solution for this question with your students.
