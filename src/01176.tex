Identify what type of amplifier circuit this is, and also what would happen to the output voltage if $V_{in2}$ were to become more positive:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it differential amplifier} circuit.  If $V_{in2}$ were to become more positive, $V_{out}$ would become more negative.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should be able to relate this circuit to its bipolar transistor counterpart.  Ask them to explain what advantages or disadvantages this circuit holds over a bipolar differential amplifier circuit.
