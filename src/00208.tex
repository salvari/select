%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Inductors oppose changes in {\bf current}, reacting to such changes by producing a {\bf voltage}.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Emphasize to your students that inductance is an essentially {\it reactive} property, opposing change in current over time.  It is not steady current that inductors react to, only changing current.
