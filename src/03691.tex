A three-phase motor operates with a line voltage of 240 volts, a line current of 9 amps, a frequency of 60 Hz, and a power factor of 0.87 (lagging).  Draw the schematic diagram for a power-factor correction capacitor network that would connect into the motor circuit somehow to restore the power factor to a value of unity (1):

$$\epsfbox{03691x01.eps}$$

Hint: this network will require three equal-value capacitors.  Draw the network, then specify the common value of the capacitors.
