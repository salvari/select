Calculate the following parameters in this circuit (be sure to specify the polarity of each voltage with respect to ground!):

$$\epsfbox{03945x01.eps}$$

$V_{TP1}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{TP2}$ =

\vskip 10pt

$I_{R_f}$ = \hskip 80pt $V_{out}$ =

\underbar{file 03945}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{TP1}$ = 0 volts \hskip 50pt $V_{TP2}$ = 0 volts

\vskip 10pt

$I_{R_f}$ = 200 $\mu$A \hskip 50pt $V_{out}$ = -2.0 volts
