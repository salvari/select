Plot the typical frequency responses of four different filter circuits, showing signal output (amplitude) on the vertical axis and frequency on the horizontal axis:

$$\epsfbox{02571x01.eps}$$

Also, identify and label the {\it bandwidth} of the filter circuit on each plot.

$$\epsfbox{02571x02.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although "bandwidth" is usually applied first to band-pass and band-stop filters, students need to realize that it applies to the other filter types as well.  This question, in addition to reviewing the definition of bandwidth, also reviews the definition of cutoff frequency.  Ask your students to explain where the 70.7\% figure comes from.  Hint: {\it half-power} point!
