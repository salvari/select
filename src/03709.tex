Predict how all test point voltages (measured between each test point and ground) in this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_2$:

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_1$ fails open: {\it $V_{TP1}$ = no change (source voltage), $V_{TP2}$ = decrease to 0 volts, $V_{TP3}$ = decrease to 0 volts.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it $V_{TP1}$ = no change (source voltage), $V_{TP2}$ = increase to full source voltage, $V_{TP3}$ = decrease to 0 volts.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_3$ fails open: {\it $V_{TP1}$ = no change (source voltage), $V_{TP2}$ = increase to full source voltage, $V_{TP3}$ = increase to full source voltage.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_2$: {\it $V_{TP1}$ = no change (source voltage), $V_{TP2}$ = decrease, $V_{TP3}$ = increase, $V_{TP2}$ = $V_{TP3}$.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
