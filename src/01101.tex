Describe the purpose and function of this circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01101x01.eps}$$

The 120 volt AC output provided by this circuit is definitely {\it not} sinusoidal, and the circuit's frequency varies with load.  Can you think of any way(s) to improve these aspects of the circuit (you need not show details of your design modifications)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an {\it inverter} circuit.

\vskip 10pt

Be prepared to explain what each of the transistors does, and how the transformer is able to function with DC power on its primary winding.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This particular schematic was derived from a Triad brand transformer application, part number TY-75A.  Recommended transistors were Delco 2N278, Bendix 2N678, Clevite 2N1146, and Delco 2N173.  Slight variations in resistor and capacitor sizes may result in better performance.  The 3 $\Omega$ resistors should have power ratings of at least 5 watts each, and the 150 $\Omega$ resistors should be rated for at least 20 watts each.
