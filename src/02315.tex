Qualitatively determine what will happen to the series resistor current and the zener diode current in this voltage regulator circuit if the load current suddenly {\it decreases}.  Assume that the zener diode's behavior is ideal; i.e. its voltage drop holds absolutely constant throughout its operating range.

$$\epsfbox{02315x01.eps}$$

$I_{R_{series}}$ = ({\it increase, decrease, or unchanged?})

\vskip 5pt

$I_{zener}$ = ({\it increase, decrease, or unchanged?})

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If the load current decreases, $I_{zener}$ will increase and $I_{R_{series}}$ will remain unchanged.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what do you think will happen with a {\it real} zener diode, where its voltage drop does change slightly with changes in current?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A conceptual understanding of zener diode regulator circuits is important, perhaps even more important than a quantitative understanding.  Your students will need to understand what happens to the different variables in such a circuit when another parameter changes, in order to understand how these circuits will dynamically react to changing load or source conditions.
