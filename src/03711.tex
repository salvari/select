Predict how all three transistor currents ($I_B$, $I_C$, and $I_E$) will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03711x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Base resistor $R_B$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Collector resistor $R_C$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past base resistor $R_B$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past collector resistor $R_C$:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Base resistor $R_B$ fails open: {\it All three currents stop.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Collector resistor $R_C$ fails open: {\it Base current unchanged, collector current stops, emitter current decreases to value of base current ($I_E = I_B$).}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past base resistor $R_B$: {\it All three currents greatly increase, transistor will likely overheat and fail.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past collector resistor $R_C$: {\it Base current unchanged, collector current increases slightly (ideally will not change at all!), transistor dissipates more power in the form of heat (may overheat).}:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
