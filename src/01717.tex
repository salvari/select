%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Circuits {\bf A}, {\bf C}, and {\bf F} are {\it series} circuits.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to identify what distinguishing characteristic uniquely identifies a circuit as being "series."  Once this has been identified, there are several conclusions which may be deduced (regarding voltage drops, currents, resistances, etc.).

Circuit {\bf F} is thrown in the mix just to show students that the non-battery components don't have to all be the same (resistors) in order for a circuit to qualify as "series."
