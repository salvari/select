Suppose an electric current of 1.5 microamps (1.5 $\mu$A) were to go through a resistance of 2.3 mega-ohms (2.3 M$\Omega$).  How much voltage would be "dropped" across this resistance?  Show your work in calculating the answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$1.5 \times 10^{-6}$ amps of current through a resistance of $2.3 \times 10^6$ $\Omega$ will produce a voltage "drop" equal to 3.45 volts.

It is important for students to understand that metric prefixes are nothing more than "shorthand" forms of scientific notation, with each prefix corresponding to a specific power-of-ten.
