What happens to the thickness of the depletion region in a PN junction when an external voltage is applied to it?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The answer to this question depends entirely on the polarity of the applied voltage!  One polarity tends to expand the depletion region, while the opposite polarity tends to compress it.  I'll let you determine which polarity performs which action, based on your research.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what effect this change in depletion layer thickness has on overall conductivity through the PN junction.  Under what conditions will the conductivity be greatest, and under what conditions will the conductivity be least?
