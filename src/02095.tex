%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a sine-wave function generator for the AC voltage source.  Specify a cutoff frequency within the audio range.

I recommend setting the function generator output for 1 volt, to make it easier for students to measure the point of "cutoff".  You may set it at some other value, though, if you so choose (or let students set the value themselves when they test the circuit!).

I also recommend having students use an oscilloscope to measure AC voltage in a circuit such as this, because some digital multimeters have difficulty accurately measuring AC voltage much beyond line frequency range.  I find it particularly helpful to set the oscilloscope to the "X-Y" mode so that it draws a thin line on the screen rather than sweeps across the screen to show an actual waveform.  This makes it easier to measure peak-to-peak voltage.
