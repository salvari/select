Complete the timing diagram for this circuit, assuming all $Q$ outputs begin in the low state:

$$\epsfbox{02986x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{02986x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02986}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02986x03.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain why the "high" state at the $D$ input of the first flip-flop does not ripple through {\it all} the flip-flops at the first clock pulse.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question reviews the principles of D-type flip-flops, timing diagrams, and serves as an introduction to shift registers.
