How much voltage needs to be dropped across resistor $R_1$ in order to make voltage $V_{AB}$ equal to zero?

$$\epsfbox{00543x01.eps}$$

How much resistance must $R_1$ possess in order to drop that amount of voltage?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{R1} =$ 9 V

$R_1 =$ 20 k$\Omega$

Follow-up question: what do you notice about the four resistors' values in this condition where $V_{AB} = 0$?  Pair up these four resistors into two sets of two pairs, and calculate the ratios of those pairs.  What do you notice about these ratios?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The follow-up question regarding ratios is a good introduction to the fundamental principle of balanced bridge circuits.  Having students work through the calculations together is a good way for them to see the principle for themselves.

It is also important to note in this circuit which ratios are {\it not} in agreement with each other.  You can't just divide these four resistors into any set of two pairs and expect the ratios to equal each other!  It is very important for students to see this, as well.
