Series.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If your students don't already know, this question is an excellent opportunity for them to learn about what a "series" circuit is and how it differs from a "parallel" circuit.  Ask your students {\it why} "series" is the correct answer.  What is it about a series connection that makes it the best type of connection to use an ammeter in?  What would happen if we connected an ammeter in {\it parallel} with a circuit component?
