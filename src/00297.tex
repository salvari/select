The equation for calculating total resistance in a parallel circuit (for any number of parallel resistances) is sometimes written like this:

$$R_{total} = (R_1^{-1} + R_2^{-1} + \cdots R_n^{-1})^{-1}$$

Re-write this equation in such a way that it no longer contains any exponents.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$R_{total} = {1 \over {{1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + \cdots {1 \over R_n}}}$$

This question is an exercise in basic algebra, specifically the meaning of negative exponents.
