In this active filter circuit, how will the filter's cutoff frequency be affected by changes in the load resistance?  Be as specific as you can in your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f_{cutoff}$ is unaffected by changes in load resistance.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain the opamp's role in providing immunity to the filter circuit from load resistance changes.  {\it How} does it accomplish this feat?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what the function of the opamp is, taken by itself.  What do we call an opamp that has its output directly connected to its inverting input?  How does this function and name relate to the granting of load-impedance immunity in the filter circuit shown in the question?
