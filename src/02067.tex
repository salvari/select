Follow-up question: MOSFETs are sometimes referred to as "IGFETs".  Explain what this other acronym stands for, and how it means the same thing as "MOSFET".

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Explain to your students that IGFET is a more general term than MOSFET, as silicon dioxide is not the only suitable material from which to make an insulating layer for the gate.
