Radio-frequency amplifiers often use small inductors called {\it peaking coils} in the coupling circuitry between transistor stages.  Describe the purpose of these inductors.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

{\it Peaking coils} are added to amplifier circuits to help counteract capacitive reactance at high frequencies.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer I gave for this question is very minimal, and is just enough to give your students a hint.  Ask your students to explain why capacitive reactance is an issue in high-frequency transistor amplifier circuits, and why an inductor would be used to counter $X_C$.  Also, ask if there are any disadvantages to inserting peaking coils into amplifier circuits.
