An amplifier has a voltage gain of 5 and a current gain of 75, both figures being ratios.  Calculate the following gains:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Power gain (as a ratio)
\item{$\bullet$} Power gain (dB)
\item{$\bullet$} Voltage gain (dB)
\item{$\bullet$} Current gain (dB)
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Power gain (as a ratio) = 375
\item{$\bullet$} Power gain (dB) = 25.74 dB
\item{$\bullet$} Voltage gain (dB) = 13.98 dB
\item{$\bullet$} Current gain (dB) = 37.50 dB
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some of your students will probably get the power calculations correct, but be off by a factor of two on the voltage and current gain (dB) calculations.  Remind them that a different equation is used to calculate voltage and current gain in dB than is used in power calculations.
