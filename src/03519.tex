Identify two different component values that could be changed in this circuit to make the time constant {\it longer} (creating a {\it slower} circuit response):

$$\epsfbox{03519x01.eps}$$

Be sure to identify both the components and the directions their respective values must be changed ({\it larger} or {\it smaller}).

\underbar{file 03519}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Make $R$ {\it smaller}. \hskip 30pt Make $L$ {\it larger}.

\vskip 10pt

I recommend assigning two points to each properly identified component, and two points for each proper direction of change.
