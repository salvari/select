You must {\it desolder} the component from the board, using any number of desoldering tools:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} De-soldering "wick"
\item{$\bullet$} De-soldering bulb
\item{$\bullet$} De-soldering "pump"
\item{$\bullet$} Vacuum station
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to describe how some common desoldering tools (wick, bulb, plunger, vacuum system) work, and also ask them where they obtained their information.
