An incandescent light bulb has a filament resistance of 5.7 $\Omega$ when at room temperature (20$^{o}$ C), but draws only 225 mA when powered by a 12 volt DC source.  Given that the filament is made out of tungsten metal, calculate its temperature in degrees F when powered by the 12 VDC source.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$T =$ 3,484$^{o}$F 

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Solving this problem requires several concepts be integrated: Ohm's Law, converting between different temperature units, and calculating temperature from shift in resistance.
