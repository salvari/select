How are {\it electrolytic} capacitors constructed, and what is particularly noteworthy about their use?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Electrolytic" capacitors use a very thin layer of metal oxide as the dielectric.  The manufacturing process involves applying a DC voltage to the new capacitor to create the oxide layer.  This "polarizes" it for life, preventing its use with reverse polarity.

Follow-up question: identify the schematic symbol for any type of polarized capacitor, electrolytics included.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are many features of electrolytic capacitors unique to that type, not the least of which being their means of manufacture.  Since these capacitors are used so often for low-voltage electronic applications, it is well worth the students' time to study them well and know their idiosyncrasies.
