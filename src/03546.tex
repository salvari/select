Calculate the amount of voltage across a capacitor after charging for 3.2 time constants worth of time, assuming it began fully discharged and will ultimately reach the power supply voltage of 55 volts.  Also, calculate how many seconds of time that 3.2 time constants is if $C$ = 22 $\mu$F and $R$ = 47 k$\Omega$:

\vskip 10pt

$V_C$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} @ 3.2$\tau$

\vskip 10pt

$t$ = \underbar{\hskip 50pt} @ 3.2$\tau$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_C$ = 52.76 volts @ 3.2$\tau$

\vskip 10pt

$t$ = 3.309 seconds @ 3.2$\tau$
