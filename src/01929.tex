What do each of the oscilloscope axes represent, in real-life terms (variables and units) when used in conjunction with this curve tracer circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Horizontal axis: voltage applied across terminals of device under test (1 volt displayed = 1 volt).

\vskip 10pt

Vertical axis: current through device under test (1 volt displayed = 1 mA)

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The resistor's specified value of 1 k$\Omega$ should make perfect sense when students see the voltage:current ratio for the vertical axis!
