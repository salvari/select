Suppose the motor in this circuit refused to run, despite your voltmeter showing that there is 36 volts between points {\bf E} and {\bf J} at the battery:

$$\epsfbox{03392x01.eps}$$

Connecting your voltmeter between points {\bf C} and {\bf H} in the circuit, you measure 0 volts.  What does this indicate about the location of the fault?  Assume there is only {\it one} thing wrong with this circuit (no multiple faults!).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The fault must be somewhere to the {\it right} of points {\bf C} and {\bf H}.
