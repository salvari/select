A hobbyist decides to build a microphone preamplifier circuit, using an operational amplifier to control gain:

$$\epsfbox{03948x01.eps}$$

Unfortunately, the particular op-amp chosen by the hobbyist seems to distort the signal at high frequencies.  The hobbyist decides to look for a different model of op-amp, and asks you (an electronics technician) for advice on choosing a better one.  What specific operational amplifier performance parameter would you suggest the hobbyist look for in a new op-amp, and should this parameter be small or great in order to fix the distortion problem?

\vskip 10pt

Parameter = \hskip 150pt Ideally {\it small} or ideally {\it great}?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Parameter = "slew rate," ideally {\it great}
