{\it Impedance} is defined as the complex ratio of voltage and current:

$${\bf Z} = {{\bf V}\over {\bf I}}$$

We may determine the complex definition of impedance provided by an capacitor if we consider the equation relating capacitor voltage and capacitor current:

$$i = C {d \over dt} [ v(t) ]$$

First, substitute a phasor expression of voltage into the above equation, then differentiate with respect to time to obtain an expression for current:

$$v(t) = e^{j \omega t}$$

$$i = C {d \over dt} \left[ e^{j \omega t} \right]$$

Then, divide the two phasor expressions to obtain an expression for capacitive impedance.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$${\bf Z_C} = {1 \over {j \omega C}} \hbox{\hskip 30pt or \hskip 30pt} {\bf Z_C} = -j {1 \over {\omega C}}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: explain why the following expression for capacitive impedance is equivalent to the one shown above:

$${\bf Z_C} = {1 \over {\omega C}} \>  e^{j (-\pi / 2)}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order to solve this problem, your students must remember the basic rule for differentiating exponential functions:

$${d \over dx} \left[ e^{ax} \right] = a e^{ax}$$

This is one of the beauties of representing sinusoidal voltages and currents in complex exponential (phasor) form: it makes differentiation and integration relatively easy!  In this sense, the Euler relation of $e^{jx} = \cos x + j \sin x$ is a {\it transform function}, transforming one type of mathematical problem into a different (easier) type.
