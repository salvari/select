In many types of digital systems, a set of square-wave signals are phase-shifted from each other by 90$^{o}$.  Such a phase relationship is called {\it quadrature}.

Determine the output of a D-type latch for this pair of quadrature signals, applied to the D and E inputs over time:

$$\epsfbox{01360x01.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Then, determine the output of a D-type latch when the phase relationship is reversed, (D leading E by 90$^{o}$, instead of E leading D by 90$^{o}$):

$$\epsfbox{01360x02.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students need to be proficient in analyzing pulse diagrams, especially with latch circuits (and later, with flip-flops), because these types of circuits often find application in pulse-driven systems.
