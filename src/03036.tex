A feature found on most 7-segment decoder/driver ICs is called {\it ripple blanking}.  Describe what this feature is, and why it is used.  Hint: a good source of information on this subject is a datasheet for a 7-segment decoder/driver IC.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer I give here is purposefully vague, as usual.  What I want students to do is research datasheets on their own and be able to show where they got their information.
