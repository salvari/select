%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-voltage, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC voltage below 30 volts.  Specify a standard resistor value, somewhere between 1 k$\Omega$ and 100 k$\Omega$ (1k5, 2k2, 2k7, 3k3, 4k7, 5k1, 6k8, 10k, 22k, 33k, 39k 47k, 68k, etc.).

If using this question as a lab exercise rather than an assessment, I recommend specifying a voltage that is standard for batteries, so students don't necessarily have to have an adjustable power supply available to do this lab.

For example, specify $V_{supply}$ as 6 volts and $R_1$ as 33 k$\Omega$.  The resulting current is sufficient to provide a nice, strong needle deflection on most cheap analog ammeters, too!
