Calculating apparent power for a single-phase AC circuit is easy -- simply multiply line voltage by line current ($S = VI$):

How do we calculate apparent power in a balanced three-phase circuit, given the same figures?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$S = \sqrt{3}(VI)$

Follow-up question: suppose the three-phase system were a Delta configuration instead of a Wye configuration.  Does this influence the apparent power calculation?  Why or why not?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The formula for calculating power in a balanced three-phase system may be found in any textbook.  Let your students do the necessary research!
