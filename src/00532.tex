A technician prepares to use an oscilloscope to display an AC voltage signal.  After turning the oscilloscope on and connecting the Y input probe to the signal source test points, this display appears:

$$\epsfbox{00532x01.eps}$$

What display control(s) need to be adjusted on the oscilloscope in order to show fewer cycles of this signal on the screen, with a greater height (amplitude)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The "timebase" control needs to be adjusted for fewer seconds per division, while the "vertical" control needs to be adjusted for fewer volts per division.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss the function of both these controls with your students.  If possible, demonstrate this scenario using a real oscilloscope and function generator, and have students adjust the controls to get the waveform to display optimally.  Challenge your students to think of ways the {\it signal source} (function generator) may be adjusted to produce the display, then have them think of ways the oscilloscope controls could be adjusted to fit.
