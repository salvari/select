Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and actual truth tables.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Pushbutton switches are recommended over toggle switches for demonstrating a latch circuit.  When the contacts are momentary, the latching characteristics of the circuit becomes more evident to see.

I have intentionally requested students try different resistance values for $R_{limit}$ so they may see the effects of gate output {\it loading}, and the importance of proper logic level voltages.  Students should try undersized resistors (10 $\Omega$, perhaps) on both LEDs to generate this problem, and then use oversized resistors (1000 $\Omega$, perhaps) to make the problem go away.  Large-valued limiting resistors will cause the LEDs to be dim, but will also restore workable voltage levels so that "high" output states are actually interpreted as "high" when fed back to the gate inputs.
