Calculate the primary winding current (magnitude and phase angle) for this unloaded isolation transformer, with primary and secondary inductances of 18 Henrys each:

$$\epsfbox{01882x01.eps}$$

Assume the winding inductances are "pure" (no resistive components).

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{primary} = 17.68 \hbox{ mA} \> \angle -90^o$

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what changes, if any, would result in the primary current value is this were not an isolation transformer, but rather a transformer where the secondary inductance was something other than 18 H?  

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should realize from the answer that an unloaded transformer simply appears as an inductor to the source.
