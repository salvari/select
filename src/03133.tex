\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Normally-open, timed-closed
\item{$\bullet$} Normally-open, timed-open
\item{$\bullet$} Normally-closed, timed-closed

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{03133x02.eps}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: how do you make sense of the arrow in each contact symbol, with regard to whether the contact is timed-open or timed-closed?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to present their personal explanations of how to make sense of the arrow directions, in relation to whether the relay is "timed-open" or "timed-closed."  The correlation is really not that complex, but it is a good thing to clearly elaborate on it for the benefit of the whole class.  You may want to re-phrase the question like this: "Does the arrow represent the direction of timed motion or the direction of instantaneous motion?"
