%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question affords the opportunity to discuss electrical safety with regard to clothing (often made of cotton).  Does dry clothing offer insulation to electricity like the old-style cotton wire insulation?  Can cotton clothing be trusted to insulate you safely from hazardous voltage?
