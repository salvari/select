Suppose a JFET amplifier circuit is self-biased so that 2 mA of quiescent (DC) current goes through its drain terminal with no AC input signal applied:

$$\epsfbox{02543x01.eps}$$

Calculate the following quiescent voltages:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Gate-to-ground DC voltage ($V_G$) = 
\item{$\bullet$} Source-to-ground DC voltage ($V_S$) =
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-ground DC voltage ($V_D$) =
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-Source DC voltage ($V_{DS}$) =
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Gate-to-ground DC voltage ($V_G$) = 0 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Source-to-ground DC voltage ($V_S$) = 4.4 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-ground DC voltage ($V_D$) = 10 volts
\item{$\bullet$} Drain-to-Source DC voltage ($V_{DS}$) = 5.6 volts
