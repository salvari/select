What will happen in each of these systems to the phase voltages of the load, if one of the source phases fails open?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In the Y-Y system, with no neutral wire, one of the load phases will completely lose power, while the voltages of the other two load phases will be reduced to 86.7 \% of normal.

In the Delta-Y system, none of the phase voltages will be affected by the failure of the source phase winding.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students what these results indicate about the reliability of Y versus Delta source configurations.  Also, be sure to ask what {\it does} change in the Delta-Y system as a result of the failure.  Certainly, {\it something} must be different from before, with one winding completely failed open!
