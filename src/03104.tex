Suppose you needed to choose two resistance values to make a voltage divider with a limited adjustment range.  One of these resistors will be fixed in value ($R_1$), while the other will be variable (a potentiometer connected as a rheostat-- $R_2$):

$$\epsfbox{03104x01.eps}$$

Set up a system of simultaneous equations to solve for both $R_1$ and $R_2$, and show how you arrived at the solutions for each.

Hint: remember the series resistor voltage divider formula . . .

$$V_R = V_{total}\left( {R \over R_{total}} \right)$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1$ (fixed) = 4.286 k$\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

$R_2$ (pot) = 19.048 k$\Omega$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: you will not be able to find a potentiometer with a full-range resistance value of exactly 19.048 k$\Omega$.  Describe how you could take a standard-value potentiometer and connect it to one or more fixed-value resistors to give it this desired full-scale range.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Be sure to have your students set up their equations in front of the class so everyone can see how they did it.  Some students may opt to apply Ohm's Law to the solution of both resistors, which is good, but for the purpose of developing equations to fit problems it might not be the best solution.  Challenge your students to come up with a {\it set of equations} that solve for $R_1$ and $R_2$, then use techniques for solution of simultaneous equations to arrive at solutions for each.

The follow-up question is very practical, as it is impossible to find potentiometers ready-made to arbitrary values of full-scale resistance.  Instead, you must work with what you can find, which is usually nominal values such as 10 k$\Omega$, 50 k$\Omega$, 100 k$\Omega$, etc.
