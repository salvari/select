Explain how this special transformer is able to control power to the light bulb:

$$\epsfbox{00252x01.eps}$$

What advantages might there be to using a transformer to control AC power, as opposed to a variable resistor?

\vskip 10pt

Note: a similar type of device is called a {\it Variac}, and it enjoys the same advantages of AC power control as the variable transformer shown in the question.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This transformer controls power to the light bulb by providing a variable voltage ratio between source and load.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It may help to give some numerical examples of voltage step-down ratio for the transformer in this circuit, for students to better understand how this device controls light bulb power.  Remind your students that modern transformers are very efficient devices, with full-load efficiency ratings typically in excess of 95\%.

If students ask about the Variac, you may want to show them this diagram:

Of course, the Variac is a type of {\it autotransformer}, and as such does not provide the electrical isolation of a regular transformer.  In some instances, this may be important!
