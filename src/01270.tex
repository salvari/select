An important parameter of logic gate circuitry is {\it noise margin}.  What exactly is "noise margin," and how is it defined for logic gates?

Specifically, how much noise margin do digital circuits exclusively composed of CMOS gates have?  How does this compare with the noise margin of all-TTL circuitry?

Note: you will need to consult CMOS gate datasheets to answer this question properly.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Noise margin is the difference between the acceptable voltage limits for corresponding input and output logic states.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question, to be answered properly, involves more than just a definition of "noise margin."  Students must first discover that there is a difference between voltage compliance levels for gate inputs versus outputs, then recognize that the difference constitutes a "margin" that imposed AC voltage ("noise") must not exceed.  They must then present their answer in terms of manufacturer specifications, obtained in datasheets.  In summary, there is a lot of research that must occur to answer this question, but the results will be worth it!
