What hazards might be posed by a circuit with excessive current going through its conductors (excessive as defined by the conductors' ampacity)?  In other words, what would be bad about a wire carrying too much current?

Also determine which type of component fault, an {\it open} or a {\it short}, would most likely be the cause of excessive current in a circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Overloaded wiring gets hot -- perhaps enough to start a fire.

A {\it shorted} component could cause excessive current in a circuit, but an {\it open} fault will result in less (or no) current.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Even if an overloaded wire does not get hot enough to ignite nearby combustible material, there are other ill effects of conductor overloading.  Challenge your students to think of some other, negative consequences which may result from conductor overloading.

One of the goals of this question is for students to be able to distinguish between {\it open} and {\it short} component faults.
