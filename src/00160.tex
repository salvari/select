What does the {\it breakdown voltage} (also known as {\it dielectric strength}) rating for an electrically insulating substance mean?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The breakdown voltage, or dielectric strength, rating of an insulator is the maximum amount of applied voltage it may withstand per unit thickness without conducting appreciable current.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question provides an opportunity for "qualitative" analysis: does the voltage rating of an insulator increase or decrease as its thickness is increased, given a constant dielectric strength?
