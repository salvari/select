Note that the LEDs shown in the schematic do not have voltage-dropping resistors connected in series.  How is this possible, especially considering the author's prototype circuit operated at 12 volts DC (far in excess of an LED's continuous rating)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Since the LEDs only turn on during the discharge phase of the 555's timing cycle (which is very short), greater-than-rated voltages and currents are permissible.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question illustrates how the advertised ratings of electronic components assume certain conditions.  If one understands what these assumptions are, the component ratings may be safely "exceeded" under special conditions.  This is one such special case.
