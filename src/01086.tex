A student of electronics has just recently learned how to build audio amplifier circuits, and this inspires dreams of designing a super-powerful amplifier for a home entertainment system.  One day, this student comes across a donation of electronic components from a local business, and in this donation are several industrial SCRs, rated at 20 amps each.

``Wow,'' says the student, ``these components look like really big transistors, but they're rated for a lot of current.  I could build a {\it huge} amplifier with these!''

The student approaches you for advice, because you've just recently learned how SCRs function in your electronics class.  What do you tell the student, concerning the use of SCRs as audio amplification devices?  How do you explain to this excited student that these devices will not work in an amplifier circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you determine the reason why SCRs cannot be used as audio amplification devices.

Believe it or not, I was once approached by an enthusiastic student with this very question!

%INDEX% Thyristors, unsuitability for linear amplification
