The following three-stage BJT amplifier has a problem: no output signal.

$$\epsfbox{02551x01.eps}$$

You take two voltage measurements with an oscilloscope to begin your troubleshooting: voltage at the collector of transistor $Q_1$ and voltage at the collector of transistor $Q_2$, both with respect to ground.  What you find is a normal AC signal at the collector of $Q_1$, but no AC signal (DC only) at the collector of $Q_2$.

From this information, identify two possible faults that could account for the problem and all measured values in this circuit, and also identify two circuit elements that could not possibly be to blame (i.e. two things that you know {\it must} be functioning properly, no matter what else may be faulted) other than the power supply and the signal source.  The circuit elements you identify as either possibly faulted or properly functioning can be wires, traces, and connections as well as components.  Be as specific as you can in your answers, identifying both the circuit element and the type of fault.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Note: the following answers are not exhaustive.  There may be more circuit elements possibly at fault and more circuit elements known to be functioning properly!

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Circuit elements that are possibly faulted
\item{1.} Transistor $Q_2$ failed shorted or open
\item{2.} Resistor $R_7$ failed open
\item{3.} Resistor $R_8$ failed open
\item{4.} Capacitor $C_4$ failed shorted
\medskip

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Circuit elements that must be functioning properly (besides power supply and signal source)
\item{1.} Transistor $Q_1$
\item{2.} Resistor $R_3$
\item{3.} Resistor $R_4$
