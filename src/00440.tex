Small inductors often look like resistors, even to the extent that their values are designated by colored bands.  Determine the values of the following inductors (express the tolerance as a percentage), based on their color codes:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Red, Grn, Brn, Gld
\item{$\bullet$} Wht, Org, Red, Sil
\item{$\bullet$} Grn, Gry, Blk
\item{$\bullet$} Vio, Blu, Org, Gld
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Red, Grn, Brn, Gld = 250 $\mu$H, +/- 5\%
\item{$\bullet$} Wht, Org, Red, Sil = 9300 $\mu$H, +/- 10\%
\item{$\bullet$} Grn, Gry, Blk = 58 $\mu$H, +/- 20\%
\item{$\bullet$} Vio, Blu, Org, Gld = 76 mH, +/- 5\%
\medskip

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students will note a lot of similarities between the inductor color code and the resistor color code, but they should also note one significant difference!
