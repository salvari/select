High-precision ohmmeters use a {\it four-wire} electrical connection to the resistance under test, rather than a two-wire connection.  Explain how the four-wire system works, and why it provides better accuracy than two-wire resistance measurement.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Two-wire ohmmeters measure not only the resistance under test, but also the added resistance of their own test leads.  Four-wire ohmmeters {\it only} measure the resistance under test.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It is one thing to explain how four-wire resistance measurement works, but another to describe how you would set up your own four-wire ("Kelvin") resistance measurement system using normal two-wire meters.  Challenge your students with this problem, to test their comprehension of the concept.
