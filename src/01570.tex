This stereo system has a problem: only one of the two speakers is emitting sound.  While the left speaker seems to be working just fine, the right speaker is silent regardless of where any of the stereo's controls are set:

$$\epsfbox{01570x01.eps}$$

Identify three possible faults that could cause this problem to occur, and identify what components of the stereo system are known to be okay (be sure to count each cable as a separate component of the system!).

Explain how you might go about troubleshooting this problem, using no test equipment whatsoever.  Remember that the speaker cables detach easily from the speakers and from the amplifier.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Components known to be okay include the left speaker, left speaker cable, and power cord for the amplifier.  There are, of course, more known "good" components in this system that the three mentioned here, especially if you count discrete electronic components inside the amplifier itself.

Possible faults include the right speaker, the right speaker cable, and the right output channel of the amplifier.  A very good way to determine which of these components is faulted is to swap cables and speakers between sides, but I'll let you determine which component swaps test which components.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Swapping components can be a very powerful means of troubleshooting system problems where interchangeable components exist.
