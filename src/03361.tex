%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

To ``lock out'' a circuit means to place a padlock on the handle of a circuit breaker or other disconnect device so that it cannot be turned on without the lock's owner releasing it first.  ``Tag out'' means to hang a tag on that same disconnect device to alert people why it is turned off.
