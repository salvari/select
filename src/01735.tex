A {\it voltage source} is a source of electricity that (ideally) outputs a constant voltage.  That is, a perfect voltage source will hold its output voltage constant regardless of the load imposed upon it:

In real life, there is no such thing as a perfect voltage source, but sources having extremely low internal resistance come close.

Another type of electricity source is the {\it current source}, which (ideally) outputs a constant current regardless of the load imposed upon it.  A common symbol for a current source is a circle with an arrow inside (always pointing in the direction of conventional flow, not electron flow!).  Another symbol is two intersecting circles, with an arrow nearby pointing in the direction of conventional flow:

Predict how an ideal current source would behave for the following two load scenarios:

Follow-up question: identify the polarity of the voltage drops across the resistors in the circuits shown above.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Let students know that there really is such a thing as a perfect current source, just as there is no such thing as a perfect voltage source.  However, there are devices the closely approximate ideal current sources (current transformers in AC circuits and "current mirror" DC transistor circuits, for example).
