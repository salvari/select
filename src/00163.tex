In calculating the thickness of insulators for high-voltage AC power lines, which type of measurement is the best to use for voltage: peak, average, or RMS?  Explain why.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Peak voltage is the most appropriate type of measurement for calculating insulator thickness.  The reason why has to do with the time required for an insulator to "flash over."

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A closely related subject is {\it insulator breakdown}, or {\it dielectric strength}.  What actually happens when the dielectric strength rating of an insulator is exceeded?
