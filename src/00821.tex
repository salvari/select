How fast must a 12-pole alternator spin in order to produce 60 Hz AC power?  Write a mathematical equation solving for speed ($S$) in terms of frequency ($f$) and the number of poles ($N$).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$S =$ 600 RPM, for $f =$ 60 Hz.

$$S = {{120 f} \over N}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for the number of poles ($N$) needed in a generator given speed ($S$) and frequency ($f$).

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This may be especially confusing to some students, until they realize that alternator poles are always multiples of 2 (the simplest alternator having 2 poles).
