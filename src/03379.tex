The following schematic diagram shows a generator powering a resistive load through wires which also have their own resistances:

$$\epsfbox{03379x01.eps}$$

Calculate the following power parameters:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Power output by generator ($P_{gen}$) = 
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Power dissipated by load ($P_{load}$) =
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Power lost in wiring ($P_{lines}$) = 
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} System efficiency ($\eta$) = 
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Power output by generator ($P_{gen}$) = 2.490 kW
\item{$\bullet$} Power dissipated by load ($P_{load}$) = 2.183 kW
\item{$\bullet$} Power lost in wiring ($P_{lines}$) = 307.5 W
\item{$\bullet$} System efficiency ($P_{load} \over P_{gen}$) = 87.65 \%
