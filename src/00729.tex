$$\epsfbox{00729x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00729}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Range = 500 mA

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Determining the ranges for this ammeter is simply an exercise in Ohm's Law.  It is very important that your students recognize the shunt resistor's value as being in {\it milli}ohms and not {\it Mega}ohms!  Yes, there is a difference between a lower-case letter "m" and a capital letter "M"!
