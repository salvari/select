%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, students must calculate values for $C_1$ and $R_1$ that will produce the $V_{out}$ waveshape specified in the "Given conditions" oscilloscope plot.  The input signal, of course, is a square wave.  Students must calculate the time constant of the circuit ($\tau$) such that the pulse fully decays within the pulse width (half-period) of the square wave.  With $5 \tau$ being the accepted standard for full charge/discharge of a time-constant circuit, this is an easy calculation.

There are many different combinations of values for $C_1$ and $R_1$ possible for any given square-wave signal frequencies.  The purpose of this exercise is for students to be able to predict and select practical component values from their parts kits.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
