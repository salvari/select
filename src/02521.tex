An important parameter of any differential amplifier -- bare opamps and difference amplifiers made from opamps alike -- is {\it common-mode rejection}, or CMR.  Explain what this parameter means, how the following circuit tests this parameter, and why it is important to us:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

CMR measures the degree to which a differential amplifier ignores common-mode signals.

Follow-up question: what range of CMR values would you expect from a good differential amplifier, if subjected to the test shown in the schematic and CMR calculated by the given formula?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In case some students do not recall (!), the logarithmic formula is nothing special.  It simply provides an answer in units of decibels.
