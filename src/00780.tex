What would this permanent-magnet DC motor do, if powered by the following circuit?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The motor would spin in one direction, at least for a short moment in time.  Then, something in the circuit (either the diode or the power supply) would fail due to excessive current!

Follow-up question: identify the polarity of the DC voltage between the motor terminals, during that brief period of time where all component are still functioning.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students why this circuit is self-destructive.  If it functions as a rectifier for powering the DC motor for a short period of time, then why doesn't it function that way for an indefinite period of time?
