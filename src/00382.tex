If an electric current is passed through this wire, which direction will the wire be pushed (by the interaction of the magnetic fields)?

$$\epsfbox{00382x01.eps}$$

Is this an example of an electric {\it motor} or an electric {\it generator}?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The wire will be pushed {\it up} in this {\it motor} example.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A visual aid to understanding the interaction of the two magnetic fields is a diagram showing the lines of flux emanating from the permanent magnets, against the circular lines of flux around the wire.  Ask those students who came across similar illustrations in their research to draw a picture of this on the board in front of the class, for those who have not seen it.
