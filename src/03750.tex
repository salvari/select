Predict how the operation of this strobe light circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

$$\epsfbox{03750x01.eps}$$

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_2$:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_4$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_4$ fails open (collector-to-emitter):
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_2$ fails open:
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_2$ fails shorted:
\medskip

For each of these conditions, explain {\it why} the resulting effects will occur.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails open: {\it No light from flash tube, possible failure of transformer primary winding and/or transistor $Q_4$ due to overheating.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_1$ fails shorted: {\it No light from flash tube.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_2$ fails open: {\it No light from flash tube.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_2$: {\it Faster strobe rate for any given position of potentiometer $R_1$, possibility of adjusting the strobe rate too high where the flash tube just refuses to flash.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_4$ fails open: {\it No light from flash tube.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $Q_4$ fails open (collector-to-emitter): {\it No light from flash tube.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_2$ fails open: {\it Possible damage to transistor $Q_4$ from excessive transient voltages.}
\vskip 5pt
\item{$\bullet$} Capacitor $C_2$ fails shorted: {\it No light from flash tube, $Q_4$ will almost certainly fail due to overheating.}

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to approach the domain of circuit troubleshooting from a perspective of knowing what the fault is, rather than only knowing what the symptoms are.  Although this is not necessarily a realistic perspective, it helps students build the foundational knowledge necessary to diagnose a faulted circuit from empirical data.  Questions such as this should be followed (eventually) by other questions asking students to identify likely faults based on measurements.
