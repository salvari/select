What causes harmonics to form in the output of a transistor amplifier circuit, if the input waveform is perfectly sinusoidal (free from harmonics)?  Be as specific as you can in your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Any feature (or fault) of the circuit causing imperfect signal reproduction will necessarily create harmonics, for it will turn a perfectly sinusoidal input signal into a distorted (non-perfect-sinusoidal) signal.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the nature of harmonics: how {\it multiple} sinusoidal waveforms are necessarily contained in any periodic waveform that is not perfectly sinusoidal itself.
