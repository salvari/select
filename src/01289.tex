The following schematic is of a relay circuit that emulates a standard digital logic gate function:

$$\epsfbox{01289x01.eps}$$

Write a truth table for this circuit's function, and determine what name best represents it (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, or NOT).

\underbar{file 01289}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is an OR function.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to identify what arrangement the relay contacts are connected it: series or parallel?  Does this contact arrangement make sense with regard to the established function of the gate?
