%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If you want to add more challenge to this question, ask your students to come up with practical component values.  Of course, you will need to provide some base values such as:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Maximum motor current (locked-rotor)
\item{$\bullet$} Motor supply voltage
\item{$\bullet$} Relay coil current
\item{$\bullet$} Transistor $\beta$
\medskip

%INDEX% Protective relay circuit, motor overcurrent
