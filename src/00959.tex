Explain the effects of increasing the load resistance in this amplifier circuit.  As the load becomes more resistive, will the input signal ($V_{in}$) have more or less effect on the output voltage ($V_{out}$) than before?  Express your answer in terms of voltage gain ($A_V$).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

As the load resistor increases in value, the voltage gain of the amplifier will increase.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to imagine two scenarios of extreme resistance change for R3: shorted and open.  Does this "thought experiment" help to see the effects of changing load resistance?  If not, imagine two (lesser) extreme load resistance values: 1 ohm versus 1 million ohms.  Now is the effect of load resistance change apparent?

Another question to provoke deep thought about this circuit is to ask what the effects of load resistance change will be on this circuit's load line.  Does a greater load resistance make for a steeper load line, or a shallower load line?  How does this relate to voltage gain?
