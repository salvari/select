Calculate the theoretical length for a "half-wave" antenna, assuming a transmitter "carrier" frequency of 105.3 MHz:

$$\epsfbox{02281x01.eps}$$

Also, calculate the practical antenna length considering the "end effect," which makes the antenna's {\it electrical length} slightly different from its {\it physical length} (assume a $K$ factor of 0.95).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$\left({\lambda \over 2}\right)_{theoretical}$ = 1.425 meters 

\vskip 10pt

$\left({\lambda \over 2}\right)_{practical}$ = 1.353 meters

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Here, students must understand the mathematical relationship between antenna length and operating frequency, both theoretical and practical.
