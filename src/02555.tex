Identify the type of BJT amplifier circuit ({\it common-emitter}, {\it common-collector}, or {\it common-base}) that is most similar to a {\it common-source} JFET amplifier in terms of performance, and also identify whether these similar amplifier circuits are {\it inverting} or {\it noninverting}.

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Common-source most resembles BJT (choose one: C-E, C-C, or C-B)
\item{$\bullet$} Common-source is (choose one: inverting or noninverting)
