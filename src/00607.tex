Calculate the power supply frequency at which the reactances of a 33 $\mu$F and a 75 mH inductor are exactly equal to each other.  Derive a mathematical equation from the individual reactance equations ($X_L = 2 \pi f L$ and $X_C = {1 \over {2 \pi f C}}$), solving for frequency ($f$) in terms of $L$ and $C$ in this condition.

Calculate the total impedance of these two components, if they were connected in series, at that frequency.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$f_{resonant} =$ 101.17 Hz.  At this frequency, $Z_{series} =$ 0 $\Omega$.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The answer gives away the meaning of this question: the determination of an LC circuit's {\it resonant} frequency.  Students may be surprised at the total impedance figure of 0 $\Omega$, but this is really nothing more than an extension of the "impedance cancellation" concept they've seen before in other series LC circuit questions.  In this case, the cancellation concept has merely been taken to the ultimate level of {\it total} cancellation between the two impedances.
