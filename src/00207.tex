%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Capacitors oppose changes in {\bf voltage}, reacting to such changes by producing a {\bf current}.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Emphasize to your students that capacitance is an essentially {\it reactive} property, opposing change in voltage over time.  It is not steady voltage that capacitors react to, only changing voltage.
