Suppose an automobile manufacturer was designing a new car engine design, and they needed a memory chip to store {\it look-up tables} for the engine's control computer, holding data such as optimum fuel/air ratios for different engine loads which the computer would then consult to maintain best performance, or economy, or emissions.  What type of memory chip would you recommend for the task, and why?  Choose from the following list:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Static RAM (SRAM)
\item{$\bullet$} Mask ROM
\item{$\bullet$} PROM
\item{$\bullet$} Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
\item{$\bullet$} EPROM
\item{$\bullet$} Magnetic core
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

EPROM would probably be the best choice.  I'll let you discuss this with your classmates and with your instructor, though!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question is multi-faceted.  Students must consider volatility and ease of updating (the data), as well as simply applying the concept of a look-up table to a car's engine control computer, in order to intelligently answer this question.
