Explain what a {\it Schottky diode} is, and how it differs in construction and in function from a normal semiconductor PN junction diode.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A Schottky diode, otherwise known as a {\it hot carrier} diode, is formed by a junction of metal and N-type semiconducting material.  These diodes have less forward voltage drop, faster reverse-recovery time, more reverse leakage current, and less reverse voltage capability than regular PN junction diodes.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students if they happened to research any datasheets for Schottky diodes, and if they have parameters to compare against typical PN junction rectifying diodes such as the 1N400x series.
