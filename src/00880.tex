Many op-amp circuits require a {\it dual} or {\it split} power supply, consisting of three power terminals: +V, -V, and Ground.  Draw the necessary connections between the 6-volt batteries in this schematic diagram to provide +12 V, -12 V, and Ground to this op-amp:

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

I encourage your students to learn how to power op-amp circuits with interconnected batteries, because it really helps to build their understanding of what a "split" power supply is, as well as allow them to build functioning op-amp circuits in the absence of a quality benchtop power supply.
