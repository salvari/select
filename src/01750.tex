Calculate the percentage of total current for each resistor in this parallel circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01750x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01750}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1 = $ 50.3\% of total current

$R_2 = $ 27.6\% of total current

$R_3 = $ 22.1\% of total current

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing to comment on here, really.  Just a straight-forward current divider formula problem!
