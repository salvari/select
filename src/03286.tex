%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In this diagram, phasor ${\bf B}$ is leading phasor ${\bf A}$.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: using a protractor, estimate the amount of phase shift between these two phasors.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It may be helpful to your students to remind them of the standard orientation for phase angles in phasor diagrams (0 degrees to the right, 90 degrees up, etc.).
