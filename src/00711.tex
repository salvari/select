Most introductory textbooks will tell you that a silicon PN junction drops 0.7 volts when forward-biased, and a germanium PN junction drops 0.3 volts when forward biased.  Design a circuit that tests the "forward voltage" ($V_F$) of a PN-junction diode, so you may measure the voltage yourself, without the use of a special diode-testing meter.

Ask your students how they would determine the size of resistor to use for this "diode test" circuit.  Would be permissible to use any arbitrary value of resistor, or does the value matter significantly?
