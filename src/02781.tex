Write the Boolean expression for each of these relay logic circuits, showing how the output ($Q$) algebraically relates to the inputs ($A$ and $B$):

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order to familiarize students with Boolean algebra and how it relates to relay logic circuitry, I like to give them daily practice with questions such as this.  Students need to be able to figure out how each one of these ladder logic circuits works, and also be able to associate the proper Boolean expression with each one, or else they will have difficulty analyzing more complex relay circuits later on.
