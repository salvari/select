Some inexpensive household lamps use a diode to achieve two-position light control (dim and bright):

$$\epsfbox{00782x01.eps}$$

Explain how this circuit is able to make the light bulb glow brighter and dimmer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

With the switch in the "dim" position, the light bulb only receives power for one-half of the AC cycle.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: does it matter which way the diode is oriented in the circuit?  If we reversed its connections, would the light bulb behave any differently?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although this circuit is not very complex, it reveals an application of diode rectification often overlooked: power control for non-polarized loads.  Ask your students how the energy efficiency of a circuit like this compares to a rheostat (resistive) light dimming circuit.
