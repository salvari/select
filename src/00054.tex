Apply the following terms to this graph of an AC voltage measured over time:

\medskip 
\item{$\bullet$} Frequency
\item{$\bullet$} Period
\item{$\bullet$} Hertz
\item{$\bullet$} Amplitude
\medskip 

$$\epsfbox{00054x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{00054x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

As always, it is more important to be able to apply a term to a real-life example than it is to memorize a definition for that term.  In my experience, many students prefer to memorize definitions for terms rather than to go through the trouble of understanding how those terms apply to real life.  Make sure students realize just how and why these AC terms apply to a waveform such as this.

%INDEX% Frequency, defined
%INDEX% Period, defined
%INDEX% Cycle, defined
%INDEX% Hertz, defined
%INDEX% Amplitude, defined
