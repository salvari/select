Identify at least two independent component faults which could cause this square root extraction circuit to always output 0 volts instead of the square root of input voltage $x$ as it should:

$$\epsfbox{03806x01.eps}$$

Explain why each of your proposed faults would cause the output to stay at 0 volts.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Here are just a few possibilities: resistor $R_2$ failed open, solder bridge across resistor $R_3$, $Q_2$ failed open.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students will likely identify opamp $U_3$ as a potential fault, but this is really too easy.  Encourage them to seek more {\it interesting} fault possibilities!
