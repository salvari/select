The output of the following gate circuit is always low, no matter what states the input switches are in.  Assume that CMOS logic gates are being used here:

$$\epsfbox{02892x01.eps}$$

Identify which of these possibilities could account for the output always being low:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Output of $U_1$ stuck in a high state
\item{$\bullet$} Output of $U_1$ stuck in a low state
\item{$\bullet$} $R_1$ failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Switch C failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Switch B failed open
\item{$\bullet$} Switch A failed shorted
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Only these two possibilities could account for the output always being low:

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} Output of $U_1$ stuck in a low state
\item{$\bullet$} Switch C failed open
\medskip

Follow-up question: determine what each of the other faults would do to the circuit.

Questions like this help students hone their troubleshooting skills by forcing them to think through the consequences of each possibility.  This is an essential step in troubleshooting, and it requires a firm understanding of circuit function.

If a student suggests switch B failing open could cause the output to remain low, they are either misunderstanding the operation of an OR gate, or they are assuming switch A has also failed open (or something else happening that keeps input A low all the time).  I find this kind of assumption frequently in students new to troubleshooting: assuming multiple faults.  While multiple faults are not impossible, they are less likely than single faults.  Therefore, the good technician {\it first} looks for single faults capable of accounting for all observed states before looking for (less likely) combinations of faults.  This is a practical application of Occam's Razor.
