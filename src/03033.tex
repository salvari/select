The purpose of this circuit is to perform a timing function, turning on the LED for a limited amount of time when the switch is thrown to the right:

$$\epsfbox{03033x01.eps}$$

Suppose the switch begins in the left position, then is thrown to the right for exactly 1 second.  During that 1 second of time, how much total time does the LED spend energized (on), and how much total time does the LED spend de-energized (off)?

\vskip 10pt

LED total on time = \hskip 100pt LED total off time =

\underbar{file 03033}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

LED total on time = 0.3431 s \hskip 100pt LED total off time = 0.6569 s
