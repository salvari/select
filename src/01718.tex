%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Circuits {\bf D} and {\bf E} are {\it parallel} circuits.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to identify what distinguishing characteristic uniquely identifies a circuit as being "parallel."  Once this has been identified, there are several conclusions which may be deduced (regarding voltage drops, currents, resistances, etc.).

Some students may have difficulty distinguishing that circuit {\bf E} is a parallel circuit, but it is!
