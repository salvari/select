$$\epsfbox{01302x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01302}

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{01302x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The process of converting relay logic circuits into Boolean expressions is not quite as simple as it is converting gate circuits into Boolean expressions, but it is manageable.  Have your students share whatever methods or "tricks" they use to write the expressions with the rest of the class.
