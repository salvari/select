Suppose you need to power a 120 volt, 600 watt heating element from a 240 volt source.  You happen to have several 240V/120V step-down transformers on hand, but each one is only rated at 400 VA.  Draw a schematic diagram showing how multiple transformers could be used to match the 120 volt load to the 240 volt source.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In case you students have not yet studied AC power (watts, volt-amps, and volt-amps reactive), let them determine what "VA" means first, and then let them know it is simply equivalent to "watts" for a resistive load.

It is a very realistic problem to have to match available components to a particular task, so this question is worth your students' while to discuss and understand thoroughly.
