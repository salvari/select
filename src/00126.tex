Note the "50 ohm" rating printed on the jacket of the cable.  What will an ohmmeter register when connected between the inner conductor and shield of the cable?  What will an ohmmeter register when connected between opposite ends of either the inner conductor or the shield, from one end of the cable to the other?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Resistance between inner conductor and shield = (infinite)

Resistance between ends of inner conductor = nearly 0 ohms

Resistance between ends of shield conductor = nearly 0 ohms

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

It would be a great idea to have some samples of RG-58/U (or other coaxial cable type) available in your laboratory for students to measure themselves.  There is nothing like direct, hands-on experimentation to make a point!
