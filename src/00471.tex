What is magnetic {\it saturation}?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Magnetic "saturation" is what happens when the magnetic flux ($\Phi$, or flux density $B$) fails to increase in the same proportion to increases in magnetic field force (${\cal F}$, or field intensity $H$) that it did at lower levels of $\cal F$ or $H$.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

To use an economic phrase, saturation is a case of {\it diminishing returns}: where further increases in one variable yield smaller and smaller gains in another variable.  It is important that students recognize the word "saturation" is used to describe phenomena other than magnetism, as well.  But in any context it is used, the "diminishing returns" concept is the same.
