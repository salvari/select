It is common to see a capacitor connected between the "Control" terminal and ground in 555 timer circuits, especially when precise timing is important.  

$$\epsfbox{01434x01.eps}$$

Explain what purpose the capacitor $C_2$ serves in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$C_2$ acts as a decoupling capacitor, to help stabilize the threshold and trigger reference voltages internal to the 555.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: what operational parameters of the circuit define the necessary capacitance value of $C_2$?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Decoupling power supply pins on a chip is important, but here students get to see another variation of decoupling.  If time permits, work through a sample problem with your students sizing capacitor $C_2$, given a certain operating frequency of the astable circuit.  Note: this will give you another opportunity to use Th\'evenin's Theorem . . .
