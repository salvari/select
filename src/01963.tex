According to Ohm's Law, how much current goes through each of the two resistors in this circuit?

$$\epsfbox{01963x01.eps}$$

Draw the paths of all currents in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I_{R(2.2k)} = 10.91 \hbox{ mA}$

$I_{R(4.7k)} = 5.11 \hbox{ mA}$

$$\epsfbox{01963x02.eps}$$

Follow-up question: how much {\it total} current does the battery supply to the circuit, given these individual resistor currents?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A key element to this question is the plotting of currents.  Students need to see how individual resistor currents graphically relate to the total source current in a parallel circuit, because this has direct bearing on the calculation of total current, and also to an understanding of total resistance in parallel circuits.
