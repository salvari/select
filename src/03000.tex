%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Your outline need not be formal -- just be sure to mention all the major subjects and concepts.  The more you can think of, and the more detail in which you are able to elaborate, the better you have learned it.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question makes an excellent pre-test question: completed outside of class and collected immediately before the exam is taken.  The real purpose for it, of course, is to get students to think about what they have learned, which is metacognition.
