Suppose that a "noisy" AC signal of otherwise constant frequency is connected to the input of a phase-locked loop circuit:

$$\epsfbox{01147x01.eps}$$

Characterize the output waveform generated by the VCO.  Will it be "noisy" as well?  Why or why not?

\underbar{file 01147}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The VCO's output waveform will not be noisy like the input waveform.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students how this behavior of the PLL circuit could be advantageous.  What practical purpose(s) can students think of for a PLL, used as such?
