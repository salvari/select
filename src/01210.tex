%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Lots of conversions to do here!  I particularly like the "table" format shown here for practicing numeration system conversions, because it compresses a lot of practice into a small space on paper, and also because it allows students to use different methods of conversion.  For example, in converting a decimal number to the other forms, a student might choose to convert first to binary, then from binary to octal and hex.  Or, alternatively, a student may choose to convert from decimal into hex, then from hex into binary, then from binary to octal, the last two conversions being especially easy.

%INDEX% Conversion, numeration base
