This {\it digital-to-analog} converter (DAC) circuit takes a four-bit binary input (input terminals A through D) and converts it to an analog voltage ($V_{out}$).  Predict how the operation of this circuit will be affected as a result of the following faults.  Consider each fault independently (i.e. one at a time, no multiple faults):

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} Bilateral switch $U_1$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ same for all odd numbered input conditions as it is for next lowest even-numbered input condition (e.g. input value of 5 gives same output as input value of 4).}
\item{$\bullet$} Zener diode fails shorted: {\it $V_{out}$ is nearly zero volts for any input condition.}
\item{$\bullet$} Solder bridge (short) past resistor $R_1$: {\it $V_{out}$ saturates positive for any given odd-valued input condition.}
\item{$\bullet$} Resistor $R_6$ fails open: {\it $V_{out}$ always saturated.}

Follow-up question \#1: is the arrow showing zener diode current drawn in the direction of electron flow or conventional flow?

Follow-up question \#2: which input bit is the most significant (MSB) and which is the least significant (LSB)?

Questions like this help students hone their troubleshooting skills by forcing them to think through the consequences of each possibility.  This is an essential step in troubleshooting, and it requires a firm understanding of circuit function.
