Plot the transfer function ($V_{out}$ versus $V_{in}$) for this opamp circuit, and explain how the circuit works:

$$\epsfbox{01015x01.eps}$$

What type of mathematical function is represented by this circuit?

%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This circuit represents an {\it exponential} function ($y \propto e^x$):

$$\epsfbox{01015x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The direction of the transfer function curve may surprise some students.  Ask them why the curve goes down (negative) for increasingly positive input voltages.
