Explain how a {\it crystal} microphone works.  Identify how the principle of piezoelectricity is put to practical use in this device.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: characterize the typical output impedance of this microphone type.  Is it generally considered a low-impedance or a high-impedance type of microphone?  Why do you think this is?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

In a crystal microphone, a small piezoelectric crystal is stressed and unstressed by sound wave pressure, generating a voltage representative of the sound wave oscillations.
