Suppose this battery and light bulb circuit failed to work:

$$\epsfbox{00123x01.eps}$$

Using a voltmeter, a technician measures 0 volts between the points C and H.  What does this single measurement indicate about the condition of the circuit?  Be as specific as you can.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Based on this one measurement, we are able to determine that there is definitely a problem in the circuit somewhere on the left-hand side (from points C and H, left).  The exact nature of the problem is unknown, but there is definitely a problem of some nature in that half of the circuit.

There may or may not be a problem on the right-hand side of the circuit, as well.  Given this single voltage measurement, we simply cannot tell.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are times when a voltmeter indication of 0 volts is just as informative concerning a circuit fault as a non-zero measurement.  In this case, the measurement tells us that a definite problem exists in one half of the circuit.
