What will an ammeter (with an input resistance of 0.5 $\Omega$) register when connected in {\it parallel} with the diode in this circuit?

$$\epsfbox{00984x01.eps}$$

Usually, ammeters are connected in {\it series} with the component whose current is to be measured.  However, in this case a parallel connection is acceptable.  Explain why, and determine the ammeter's current reading in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The ammeter will register a current of 4 mA.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A very important point to ask your students is how they figured out the meter's indication.  What circuit analysis technique did they use, and why?

Emphasize solving this problem without using a calculator to do the math.  Are your students able to determine the result by estimation alone?  Does the input resistance factor into the calculation significantly?
