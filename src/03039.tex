%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you figure out these details by researching the datasheet yourself!

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what features differentiate the 7447 decoder/driver IC from the 7448 or 7449?  How about the 74247, 74248, and 74249 decoder/driver circuits?  Be prepared to show your sources when answering this question in class.
