Simplify this logic gate circuit, which uses nothing but NAND gates to accomplish a certain logic function:

$$\epsfbox{02802x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02802}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$$\epsfbox{02802x02.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question stands as an example of how NAND gates may be used to construct different types of logic functions.  In fact, with a sufficient quantity of NAND gates, {\it any} logic function may be built.  This is why NAND gates are said to be "universal."
