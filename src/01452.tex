{\it Flash} memory is a nonvolatile memory technology, offering greater density than either SRAM or DRAM, and faster erasure than standard EPROMs.  At first, it would seem Flash memory outperforms all other memory types, but it doesn't.  What are some of the {\it disadvantages} of Flash memory, and what kind of applications is it best suited for?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Flash memories can only be erased or re-programmed in {\it blocks}, rather than single words at a time.  Also, their cycle life is quite a bit less than either SRAM or DRAM technology.
