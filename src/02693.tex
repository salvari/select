Identify the mathematical function of this circuit (if you look closely, you'll notice that the transistors are connected in such a way that they act very similar to diodes):

$$\epsfbox{02693x01.eps}$$

Note: the two resistors labeled "R" are equal in value.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This circuit takes the {\it square root} of the input signal ($y = \sqrt{x}$).

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: how could we modify this circuit so as to take the {\it cube root} of the input signal?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This circuit is not nearly as complex as it may appear at first, if students take the time to isolate it section-by-section and identify the mathematical function each section performs.
