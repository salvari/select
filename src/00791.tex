What will be the consequence of one diode failing open in the bridge rectifier of a single-phase power supply?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The (unfiltered) output voltage will be half-wave, not full-wave.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

A question such as this is best discussed while viewing the schematic diagram for a bridge rectifier.  I recommend projecting an image of a bridge rectifier circuit on a whiteboard, then having students use dry-erase markers to "mark up" the schematic with arrows for current, voltage drop indications, etc.  This way, mistakes can be corrected, or alternate cycles erased and re-drawn, without having to erase and re-draw the schematic diagram itself.
