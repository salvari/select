Identify what type of oscillator circuit this is, and write an equation describing its operating frequency:

$$\epsfbox{02672x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02672}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a {\it Wien bridge} opamp oscillator, and its operating frequency is determined in the same way as a discrete-transistor Wien bridge oscillator circuit:

$$f = {1 \over {2 \pi R C}}$$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: based on your analysis of the circuit, how much phase shift does the Wien bridge circuit introduce into the feedback signal?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Unlike some discrete transistor oscillator circuits, this Wien bridge is a complete and full Wien bridge, and not a "half-bridge".  For an example of a Wien {\it half}-bridge circuit, look at this (the Wien bridge components shown in a different color):
