If we were to plug an electric saw into a very long extension cord, and then plug the other end of the cord into a power receptacle, we would notice a decreased level of performance from the saw, as compared with how it performs when directly plugged into the same receptacle (with no extension cord).

Determine if the saw's performance becomes better or worse as the ambient temperature increases, and explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The saw's performance worsens as ambient temperature increases.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss the nature of the problem, with reference to Ohm's Law.  Ask your students to explain the effect in terms of Ohm's Law, and the cord's ability to deliver electrical power to the saw motor.
