What is the proper unit of measurement for the transconductance of a field-effect transistor (or an electron tube, which exhibits similar characteristics)?  Explain why this unit makes sense, based on the mathematical definition of transconductance.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Transconductance is measured in {\it Siemens} or {\it mhos}, the former unit being the official metric designation, and that latter being an older designation.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Although the physical meaning of transconductance ($g_m$) is significantly different from the physical meaning of conductance ($G$), they share the same unit of measurement due to their respective mathematical definitions.  Discuss the concept of {\it dimensional analysis} with your students if they have not yet been exposed to it thus far through their use of physics formulae.
