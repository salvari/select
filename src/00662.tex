All electrical sources contain some internal impedance.  This explains why voltage sources "sag" when placed under load:

$$\epsfbox{00662x01.eps}$$

In this diagram, the source's internal impedance has been "lumped" into a single component, labeled $Z_{Th}$, the Th\'evenin impedance.  This intrinsic impedance naturally limits the amount of power any source can deliver to a load.  It also creates a condition where load power is optimized at a particular load impedance.

Determine the load impedance value necessary for maximum power dissipation, if powered by an audio amplifier circuit with an internal (Th\'evenin) impedance of 4 $\Omega$.
