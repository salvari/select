If quantitative accuracy is desired from this curve tracing circuit, the shunt resistor should be {\it precisely} 1 k$\Omega$ in size.  Explain how a precise shunt resistance may be built without the use of precision components (i.e. a special 1 k$\Omega$ precision resistor).

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Hint: there's a saying in the electronics world that goes something like this: {\it "Don't make it precise, make it adjustable!"} 

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Though it may have been a while since you last discussed how to achieve precise (adjustable!) values of resistance from non-precision resistors, students should at least remember the general concept if not the exact implementation.
