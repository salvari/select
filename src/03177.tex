%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Use circuit simulation software to verify your predicted and measured parameter values.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Use a variable-current, regulated power supply to supply any amount of DC current below a few milliamps.  Students will have to choose resistor values appropriate to the task.  I recommend low-value resistors so as to keep the voltage drop (and power dissipation!) low.

An extension of this exercise is to incorporate troubleshooting questions.  Whether using this exercise as a performance assessment or simply as a concept-building lab, you might want to follow up your students' results by asking them to predict the consequences of certain circuit faults.
