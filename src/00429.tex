What resistor values would we have to choose in a Delta configuration to behave exactly the same as this Y-connected resistor network?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Each resistor in a Delta-connected network must have a value of 900 $\Omega$, to be equivalent to a Y-connected network of 300 $\Omega$ resistors.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There exist long, complicated equations for converting between Y and Delta resistor networks, but there is a much simpler solution to this problem than that!  Challenge your students to solve this problem without resorting to the use of one of those long conversion formulae.

%INDEX% Delta-wye conversion
%INDEX% Wye-delta conversion
%INDEX% Y-delta conversion
