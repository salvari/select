According to the Barkhausen criterion for a sine-wave oscillator, the total loop voltage gain needs to be 1.  Explain what will happen in these two conditions:

\medskip
\item{$\bullet$} The total loop voltage gain is less than one
\item{$\bullet$} The total loop voltage gain is greater than one
\medskip

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

\medskip
\goodbreak
\item{$\bullet$} The total loop voltage gain is less than one, ({\it the oscillations will die out})
\item{$\bullet$} The total loop voltage gain is greater than one, ({\it the oscillations will become distorted})
\medskip
