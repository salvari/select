Complete the wire connections necessary to make this a bridge circuit, where ${R_1 \over R_2} = {R_3 \over R_4}$ at balance:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This, of course, is not the only way to connect the components to make a bridge circuit!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Challenge your students to connect the resistors in a manner different from the diagram shown in the answer, to make a bridge circuit.  A good way to do this is to project an image of the original components (with no interconnections drawn) on a whiteboard with a video projector, then have students use dry-erase markers to draw the connecting wires in place.  If any errors are made, they can be very easily erased without erasing any components themselves.
