%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$V_{max}$ = 3.85 volts

\vskip 10pt

$V_{min}$ = 0.35 volts

Be sure to ask your students how they obtained their answers, not just what the answers are.  There is more than one correct way to analyze this circuit!

Incidentally, there is nothing significant about the use of European schematic symbols in this question.  I did this simply to provide students with more exposure to this schematic convention.
