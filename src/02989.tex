%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A "register" is a collection of flip-flops or latches used to store a binary number (several bits).  In essence, it is a one-word {\it memory circuit}.  A "shift register" does the same thing as a register, except that it also has the ability to {\it move} that binary word from one place to another.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Registers are a good way to introduce the basic concepts of solid-state (RAM) memory technology, showing how flip-flop or latch circuits may be used as data storage devices.  Be sure to ask your students where they were able to find this information, as it should be very easy for them to research!
