Identify the function of this active filter:

$$\epsfbox{00709x01.eps}$$

It is low pass, high pass, band pass, or band stop?  Explain your answer.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This is a band stop filter circuit.

\vskip 10pt

Challenge question: how much voltage gain does this amplifier have at resonance?  How much voltage gain does it have at $f = 0$ and $f = \infty$, if the two resistor values are equal?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

If some students have difficulty analyzing the function of this circuit, ask them to identify the total impedance of a series-connected inductor and capacitor at resonance, then transfer that amount of impedance to the circuit to see what the effects will be at the resonant frequency.
