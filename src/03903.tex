A student is trying to get a 74HC192 up/down counter to function.  However, it is simply not cooperating:

$$\epsfbox{03903x01.eps}$$

Determine what the student is doing wrong with this 74HC192, and then correct the schematic diagram.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Did you think I was just going to give the answer away here?  Consult a datasheet for the 74HC192 to see for yourself!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The point of this question is to have students research a datasheet to figure out the necessary conditions for making a digital IC perform as it should.  This is {\it extremely} important for students to get into the habit of doing, as it will save them much trouble as technicians!
