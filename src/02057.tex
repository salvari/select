Explain what {\it cutoff voltage} ($V_{GS(off)}$) is for a field-effect transistor.  Research the datasheets for some of the following field-effect transistors and determine what their respective cutoff voltages are:

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I'll let you research the definition of $V_{GS(off)}$ and the parameters of these specific field-effect transistors.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: based on your research of these datasheets, how constant is $V_{GS(off)}$ between different transistors?  In other words, is this a parameter you can accurately predict from the datasheet before purchasing a transistor, or does it vary significantly from transistor to transistor (of the same part number)?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students the significance of $V_{GS(off)}$, especially its stability (or instability, as the case may be) between transistors.  How does this impact the design of FET circuits?
