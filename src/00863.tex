Fundamentally, an {\it amplifier} is a device that takes in a low-power signal and outputs a magnified (power-boosted) facsimile of the input signal.  Explain how it is possible for such a device to exist.  Doesn't the Law of Energy Conservation ("Energy can neither be created nor destroyed") preclude the existence of a power-boosting device?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

No physical laws are violated with an amplifier, because the added power comes from an external source: a power supply.

Follow-up question: is a step-up transformer an amplifier?  Why or why not?

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The amplifiers your students will be studying are electronic devices, but other types of amplifiers exist.  Discuss with them some examples of common, non-electronic amplifiers.
