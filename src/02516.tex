Determine the amount of current from point {\bf A} to point {\bf B} in this circuit:

$$\epsfbox{02516x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 02516}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$I$ = 6.5 mA

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This question, while being an application of Kirchhoff's Current Law, is also a prelude to an inverting summer circuit, where an opamp takes that 6.5 mA (total) current and converts it into an output voltage.
