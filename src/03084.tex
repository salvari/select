Determine the $Q$ output states of this counter circuit after the {\it next} clock pulse, given the current conditions shown ($Q_3$ and $Q_1$ high, $Q_2$ and $Q_0$ low):

$$\epsfbox{03084x01.eps}$$

After next clock pulse:

\vskip 10pt

$Q_0$ = \hskip 50pt $Q_1$ = \hskip 50pt $Q_2$ = \hskip 50pt $Q_3$ =

\underbar{file 03084}
