Size all three resistors in this voltage divider circuit to provide the necessary voltages to the loads, given the load voltage and current specifications shown:

$$\epsfbox{01783x01.eps}$$

Assume a bleed current of 1.5 mA.  As part of your design, include the power dissipation ratings of all resistors.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$R_1 = 545.5 \> \Omega$, rated for at least 148.5 mW dissipation ($1 \over 4$ watt recommended).

$R_2 = 933.3 \> \Omega$, $1 \over 8$ watt power dissipation is more than adequate. 

$R_3 = 3.2 \hbox{ k} \Omega$, $1 \over 8$ watt power dissipation is more than adequate.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Nothing special to comment on here, just a straightforward voltage divider design problem.
