Suppose we have an application where a DC generator provides power to charge a secondary-cell battery:

$$\epsfbox{00947x01.eps}$$

The only problem with this setup is, the generator tries to act as a motor when the engine turning it is shut off, drawing power from the battery and discharging it.  How could we use a rectifying diode to prevent this from happening?

This question provides a good opportunity to review the direction of current through a battery when charging, versus when discharging.  It also shows a way we can prevent the generator from "motoring" without having to use a reverse-current relay.
