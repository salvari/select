Complete a timing diagram for this synchronous counter circuit, and identify the direction of its binary count:

$$\epsfbox{01398x01.eps}$$

$$\epsfbox{01398x02.eps}$$

\underbar{file 01398}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This circuit counts {\it down}:

$$\epsfbox{01398x03.eps}$$

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students how to relate timing diagrams to binary counts (as shown in the answer).

%INDEX% Counter, synchronous down
