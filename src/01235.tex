Standard ASCII codes are seven bits in length, but communications equipment usually sends data in eight-bit (byte) groups.  The extra bit is often used as a {\it parity bit}.  What is the purpose of a "parity bit," and how is it used?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

"Parity bits" are used as a primitive form of error detection.  Communications equipment making use of parity for error detection may either be configured for "even parity" or for "odd parity".  I'll let you research and explain how parity bits are used in the transmission of ASCII data.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The concept of parity is not very complex.  It should be well within the reach of students to research on their own and report their findings to the class as a whole.
