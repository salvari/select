Identify at least two different component faults that would result in a change in duty cycle for this oscillator circuit:

$$\epsfbox{03799x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 03799}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

A short in either of the two diodes would cause the duty cycle to change.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: what would happen if either of these two diodes failed open?

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain why the duty cycle would change as a result of either diode failing shorted.  This is a good opportunity to further explore the operation of this oscillator circuit.
