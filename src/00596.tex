After a period of use, the tip of a soldering iron (or a soldering gun) becomes dark and "encrusted" with oxidation and flux residue.  Describe why this accumulation impedes the soldering process, and how it may be removed.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Discuss with your students why a wet sponge or rag works to clean the end of a heated soldering tool.  Also, discuss what to do to the tip of a soldering tool that has been abused by lack of periodic cleaning.
