What is the value of this resistor, in {\it ohms} ($\Omega$)?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Resistor value = 2700 $\Omega$, or 2.7 k$\Omega$.  

One format of component value expression popular in Europe is to replace the decimal point with the metric prefix, so 2.7 k$\Omega$ would be represented as 2k7 $\Omega$.  Not only is this notation simpler, but it also transcends the interpretational difficulties experienced between Europeans and Americans with their opposite usages of commas and decimal points.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students might not realize that in Europe, commas are used as decimal points and visa-versa.  Thus, two thousand seven hundred would be written as 2,700 in America and 2.700 in Europe.  Conversely, the number $\pi$ would be written as 3.141593 in America but 3,141593 in Europe.  Confusing?  Yes!!
