The line voltage to this three-phase load is 480 volts.  How much power (total) is dissipated by the load?  How much current is there in each line supplying the load?

$$\epsfbox{00421x01.eps}$$

One more question: write an equation for calculating power in a balanced, three-phase circuit, given line voltage and line current only.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

$P_{total} =$ 27.648 kW

$I_{line}$ = 33.255 A

I'll let you derive your own equation for power calculation.  Be ready to show your work!

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Now, students will surely be able to find a power equation from textbooks, but the purpose of this question is to have them derive it themselves.  In a single-phase, resistive AC circuit, power is given by the equation $P = I E$, just as in DC circuits.  However, if you multiply the line voltage by line current, you do not get the correct answer of 27.648 kW.  So, obviously, the equation of $P = I E$ will require some modification for calculating total three-phase power.  However, this modification is not complicated to perform.
