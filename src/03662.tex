Determine the phase shift of the output voltage ($V_{out}$) with reference to the source voltage (0$^{o}$) for each of the two switch positions, assuming the source frequency is such that $X_C = R$:

Note: you should be able to do all the necessary math mentally, without the aid of a calculating device!

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Switch left: $\Theta$ = -45$^{o}$ ($V_{out}$ lagging behind the source voltage)

\vskip 10pt

Switch right: $\Theta$ = +45$^{o}$ ($V_{out}$ leading ahead of the source voltage)

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: identify the effects of various component failures in this circuit.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

This is a very interesting circuit to built and test.  You may build one using 1 $\mu$F capacitors and 2.7 k$\Omega$ resistors that will successfully operate on 60 Hz power-line excitation.
