Draw an electrical schematic diagram of a circuit where a battery provides electrical energy to a light bulb.

\underbar{file 00007}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This schematic diagram is not the only valid way to show a battery powering a light bulb:

$$\epsfbox{00007x01.eps}$$

Other orientations of the components within the diagram are permissible.  What matters, though, is for there to be a single, continuous path for electric current from the battery, to the light bulb, and back to the other terminal of the battery.

Impress upon the students the importance of learning to "communicate" in the language of schematic diagrams.  The symbols and conventions learned here are international, and not limited to use in the United States.
