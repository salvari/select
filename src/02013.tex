What does it mean if a power supply has a DC output with 5\% ripple?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

This means the peak-to-peak ripple voltage is equal to 5\% of the DC (average) voltage.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

The purpose of this question is to get students to look up the formula for calculating ripple voltage percentage.  Notice how I did not simply ask them to regurgitate a formula; rather, I presented a realistic figure for them to interpret.  When at all possible, try to format your questions in this sort of practical context!

%INDEX% Ripple voltage, percent
