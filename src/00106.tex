What would happen if a wire having no resistance at all (0 $\Omega$) were connected directly across the terminals of a 6-volt battery?  How much current would result, according to Ohm's Law?

$$\epsfbox{00106x01.eps}$$

Suppose we were to short-circuit a 6-volt battery in the manner just described and measure 8 amps of current.  Why don't the calculated figures from the previous paragraph agree with the actual measurement?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Ohm's Law would suggest an infinite current (current = voltage divided by zero resistance).  Yet, the experiment described yields only a modest amount of current.

If you think that the wire used in the experiment is not resistance-less (i.e. it {\it does} have resistance), and that this accounts for the disparity between the predicted and measured amounts of current, you are partially correct.  Realistically, a small piece of wire such as that used in the experiment will have a few tenths of an ohm of resistance.  However, if you re-calculate current with a wire resistance of 0.1 $\Omega$, you will still find a large disparity between your prediction and the actual measured current in this short-circuit.

Follow-up question \#1: explain why wire resistance alone does not explain the modest short-circuit current.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question \#2: identify at least one safety hazard associated with a real experiment such as this.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Remind students that short-circuit testing of electrical power sources can be dangerous.  A student of mine once stuffed a 6-volt "lantern" battery in his tool pouch, only to have it discharge smoke an hour later, after the battery terminals had been shorted together by a wrench handle!

No, Ohm's Law is not being cheated here: shorting a voltage source with a 0 $\Omega$ conductor will not result in infinite current, because there are {\it other} sources of resistance in such a circuit.  The task here is to determine where those sources might be, and how they could be located.
