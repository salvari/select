Calculate the total impedance of this series network of impedances, in complex form:

$$\epsfbox{00636x01.eps}$$

\underbar{file 00636}
%(END_QUESTION)





%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

${\bf Z_{total}} =$ 1.526 k$\Omega$ $\angle$ 9.336$^{o}$

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: overall, does this network behave more like a capacitor, an inductor, or a resistor?  Explain your answer.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Students should find series impedance calculations very similar to series (DC) resistance calculations, the only significant difference being the use of complex instead of scalar numbers.
