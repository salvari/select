%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

I won't give away all the details here, but the dual-slope converter uses the same integrator and binary counter that the single-slope ADC does.  However, the integrator is used a bit differently in the dual-slope design, the benefits being greater immunity to high-frequency noise on the input signal and greater accuracy due to relative insensitivity to integrator component values.

Tutorials abound on simple ADC strategies, so your students should have little problem locating an adequate explanation for the operation of a dual-slope ADC.
