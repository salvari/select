What will happen to the function of this ammeter circuit, if the wire marked in the illustration were to fail open?

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If the wire were to fail open, the ammeter would not respond at all to any amount of input current.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Some students may think the ammeter will fail to respond at all with an open resistor, because they associate "open" faults with lack of current, and lack of current with zero response from the meter movement.  Careful examination of the circuit, however, reveals that the exact opposite will happen.
