%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

Check for the presence of voltage on the conductors of the circuit to be worked on.

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There is more to this answer than simply "check for voltage."  Ask your students to explain what types of voltage they need to check for, and how they can ensure their voltmeters are properly functioning, so as not to "miss" detecting a dangerous condition.
