%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

2.145 H

%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Inductors tend to be even more scarce than resistors in regard to the availability of different values, so knowing how to combine different inductors together to achieve a desired total inductance is a practical skill.

It should be noted to your students that inductors may interact with one another if placed too close, due to the magnetic field of one inductor "linking" with the coil of another inductor.  This is called {\it mutual inductance}, and if present alters the otherwise straightforward series-parallel inductance relationships that one would expect to be analogous to series-parallel resistances.
