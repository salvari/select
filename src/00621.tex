Suppose this band-stop filter were to suddenly start acting as a high-pass filter.  Identify a single component failure that could cause this problem to occur:

$$\epsfbox{00621x01.eps}$$

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

If resistor $R_3$ failed open, it would cause this problem.  However, this is not the {\it only} failure that could cause the same type of problem!

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

Ask your students to explain why an open $R_2$ would cause this filter to act as a high-pass instead of a band-stop.  Then, ask them to identify other possible component failures that could cause a similar effect.

By the way, this filter circuit illustrates the popular {\it twin-tee} filter topology.
