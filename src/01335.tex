%(BEGIN_NOTES)

In order to familiarize students with standard switch contact configurations, I like to given them practice with identification and truth tables each day.  Students need to be able to recognize these ladder logic sub-circuits at a glance, or else they will have difficulty analyzing more complex relay circuits that use them.
