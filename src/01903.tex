An LR differentiator circuit is used to convert a triangle wave into a square wave.  One day after years of proper operation, the circuit fails.  Instead of outputting a square wave, it outputs a triangle wave, just the same as the waveform measured at the circuit's input.  Determine what the most likely component failure is in the circuit.

%(BEGIN_ANSWER)

The inductor is failed open.

\vskip 10pt

Follow-up question: this is not the only possible failure, but it is the most likely.  Explain what the other failure(s) could be, and also why the one given here is most likely.

%(END_ANSWER)





%(BEGIN_NOTES)

There are only two components in this circuit, so determining possible failures should not be a problem at all.  To distinguish between the inductor having failed versus the resistor having failed, one needs to know which type of component failures are more likely (and why!).
