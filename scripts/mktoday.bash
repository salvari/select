# This script makes copies of all pertinent files created 
# or edited today, and copies them into a directory named
# "new".  WARNING!  This script is a total hack, and may 
# cause hysterical laughter if analyzed too closely.


# Set $DATE variable, using the "date" utility outputting in RFC 3339 format
#MONTH=`date +%b`
#DAY=`date +%e`
DATE=`date --rfc-3339=date`


# Echo these string values to the screen, just for fun
#echo "$MONTH"
#echo "$DAY"

# In each of the following search operations, "cp -v " is 
# prepended to each filename, and " new" appended to each
# filename, so as to form a complete "copy" command for 
# each filename to be executed in a script named 
# "newmake.exe" (generated by this script).
