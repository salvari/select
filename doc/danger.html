<h1>What dangers are there to teaching this way instead of lecturing?</h1>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>Instructor overload during the first year of teaching this way: an incredible amount of time is required to generate a question-based curriculum such as this, hence the creation of this site (to help other electronics instructors jump-start their efforts).</li>
<li>Learning this way is a culture shock to many students, and it may frustrate them until they begin to experience the empowerment of learning at deeper levels than they are accustomed to.</li>
<li>If a student does not understand a concept, their lack of comprehension will become exposed in the discussion arena.  If you (the instructor) do not create and nurture a supportive classroom environment, the exposure of academic weaknesses will discourage students.  Teaching this way, if not done properly, has the potential to embarrass and frustrate students to a far greater degree than lecture, where non-comprehension is more likely to go unnoticed.</li>
<li>Some students will complain that you are not doing your job as an instructor if you are not lecturing the entire class time.</li>
<li>As students learn to teach themselves, they will begin to challenge your knowledge of the subject (actually, this is a benefit in disguise).  Giving students the responsibility (and power) for learning definitely keeps you on your toes!</li>
<li>You may experience criticism from some administration and/or faculty who do not understand the benefits of departing from traditional modes of instruction.</li>
</ul>
