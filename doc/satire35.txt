"I entered the classroom with the conviction that it was crucial for me and every other student to be an active participant, not a passive consumer...[a conception of] education as the practice of freedom.... education that connects the will to know with the will to become.  Learning is a place where paradise can be created."

-- Bell Hooks, Teaching to Transgress, NY: Routledge, 1994.
