It is the mission of the pedagogue, not to make his pupils think, but to make them think right, and the more nearly his own mind pulsates with the great ebbs and flows of popular delusion and emotion, the more admirably he performs his function.  He may be an ass, but that is surely no demerit in a man paid to make asses of his customers.

-- H.L. Mencken
