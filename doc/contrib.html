<i>Socratic Electronics</i> is an "open-source" project.  Anyone is free to peruse the source files comprising this project and to modify them at will.  Some will want to return their additions and improvements to me for presentation on the official project website, in the same charitable spirit the project was provided to them.

This page lists all contributors to the project, followed by a brief description of their contributions.  I list them here in alphabetical order, by surname.
