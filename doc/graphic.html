<h1>How do I create graphic images for making my own "question" files?</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Short answer:</h2>

<p>
Use the free drafting program <tt>Xcircuit</tt>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Long answer:</h2>

<p>
<tt>Xcircuit</tt> is a simple yet powerful 2-D CAD program is specifically designed to draw electrical schematics, but it works well for many applications.  Best of all, its native output format is Encapsulated PostScript (<tt>.eps</tt>), which is exactly what <tt>TeX</tt> needs for its embedded graphic images.
</p>

<p>
The only disadvantage to using <tt>Xcircuit</tt> is that it is designed to run on Linux computers.  I've been told that running it on a Microsoft Windows computer is possible, but complicated.
</p>

<p>
You may obtain <tt>Xcircuit</tt> by downloading it from one of a few sites on the internet.  Just use "Google" for directions.
</p>

<p>
Yes, you may use other software to create graphic files for inclusion into worksheet problems, but the graphic file format <i>must</i> be Encapsulated Postscript (<tt>.eps</tt>) in order to be accepted by the "<tt>TeX</tt>" typesetting software used to compile the worksheets.  Thus, it makes sense to use a drawing/drafting program whose native output is Encapsulated PostScript, if possible.  The alternative -- to use other software packages to create non-EPS images and then convert the image format to EPS -- may result in very large graphics files, and/or images that appear "fuzzy" in the final document.
