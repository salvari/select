"Most models [of learning] assume that the purpose of learning is to incorporate new information or skills into the learner's existing knowledge structure and to make that knowledge accessible. . . . Learning begins with the need for some motivation, an intention to learn.  The learner must then concentrate attention on the important aspects of what is to be learned and differentiate them from noise in the environment.  While those important aspects are being identified, the learner accesses the prior knowledge that already exists in memory, because a key to learning is connecting what is known to what is being learned.  New information must be processed, structured, and connected in such a way as to be accessible in the future; this process is known as encoding.  The deeper the processing of the information in terms of its underlying organization, the better the learning and later retrieval of that information.  This processing requires active involvement . The learner must verify an understanding of the structure by receiving feedback, from the internal and external environments, on the encoding choices made.
